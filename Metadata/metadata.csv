"Bunnell L., Osei-Bryson K.-M., Yoon V.Y.",Development of a consumer financial goals ontology for use with FinTech applications for improving financial capability,2020.0,Consumer financial goals; Financial capability; Financial goals ontology; Ontology acquisition; Ontology engineering; Ontology evaluation,"In this research, we communicate the design and evaluation of a consumer financial goals ontology to be utilized as a knowledgebase within recommender systems applications designed to provide decision support in the domain of financial planning. The goal of this research is to provide a domain conceptualization and knowledge classification of a comprehensive set of financial capability enhancing objectives contextually appropriate for a wide range of socio-economically situated consumers. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, within the domain of consumer financial planning no formal conceptual model or knowledge classification of financial goals exists which might be utilized as a knowledgebase for applications such as a FinTech recommender system. Achieving financial goals is a key behavior associated with consumer financial capability, a topic of national economic importance. A holistic representation of domain concepts is critical for advancement of solutions to problems pertinent to a domain. One primary reason for the dearth of applications designed to assist consumers with financial goal setting is the absence of a common domain ontology of financial goals. This study addresses a gap in the literature by contributing to the research knowledgebase an ontology for a domain of consumer financial goals. In doing so, it advances scholarly research through novel domain knowledge classification while providing researchers and practitioners with an ontological knowledgebase for indexing and retrieval within applications designed to improve consumer financial capability through identification and recommendation of specific, context-aware financial goals. The ontology could be used, for example, as a knowledgebase for a Personal Financial Recommender System (PFRS), or other financial technology (FinTech) application, designed to assist users with identification, setting, and tracking of financial goals. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85089744794
Tsvirko S.,Crowdfunding as a Source of Financing in Russia: PEST Analysis,2020.0,Crowdfunding; Crowdinvesting; Crowdlending; PEST analysis; Platform,"The article focuses on the features of crowdfunding in Russia. The method of research is PEST analysis. The objective of the study was to analyze opportunities as well as problems and unsolved issues that are connected with crowdfunding in Russia. The main drivers of the development of crowdfunding in Russia, revealed in the paper, are as follows: new legislation, devoted to the crowdfunding; real need of small and medium enterprises as well non-governmental organizations in additional financial resources; demand from individual and institutional investors for new investment opportunities, especially under the conditions of lowing of the interest rates; active use of financial technologies. The most serious factors, that constrain crowdfunding in Russia, identified in the paper, are as follows: some unsolved regulatory issues; poor investors’ protection and possibility of fraud; low levels of real income and savings; low profitability of many businesses. The analysis provides a basis for different participants (projects’ founders, investors, policy makers) to exploit opportunities and minimize threats of this new approach in the sphere of finance. © 2021, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85087561724
"Pisoni G., Gijlers H.",A pilot study to inform the design of a supportive environment for challenge-based collaboration,2020.0,Challenge-based education; Collaborative work; Team dynamics,"In the course “An introduction to FinTech: from mobile payments to blockchains”, students are introduced to the broad area of FinTech, from both technical and business side. The course consists of two technical lectures that explain the students the basic technology for authentication and blockchain and two entrepreneurship lectures that discuss the fintech business ecosystem. In the rest of the course the students work on a project provided by companies in which they put into practice the obtained knowledge and provide a solution to a real life challenge. The course is face-to-face, with two weekly sessions of 2 h each. The students work in teams and each week they need to show progress/work towards the challenge resolution. The students are not constrained in any way and are asked to self organize for the team work. In this study we present the results we obtained from questionnaires that we delivered before the course on course expectations (that we used also to form the teams), during the course on teams’ dynamics, and after the course to measure students’ perception on collaboration strategies. We end the paper with a reflection on the design space for an application that can support this type of collaborative work online. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85090095463

"Uma K.S., Srinath Naidu",Prediction of intraday trend reversal in stock market index through machine learning algorithms,2020.0,Intraday move; Machine learning; Stock market prediction,"Research on stock price prediction has gained much importance in stock markets because of the immense economic value of being able to predict stock prices in advance. In this paper, we are trying to predict intraday trend reversals in a stock market index. Stock market indices often exhibit sharp intraday trend reversals of significant magnitude. If this reversal can be predicted or detected as soon as the move starts, it will be of immense economic value. Based on past data and statistical methods we can establish support and resistance levels for index and constituent shares. Usually, a sudden change in moves happens as a reversal at these levels or on crossing these levels with strong momentum. In general, traders use statistical methods like RSI (Relative Strength Index), MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence) to identify the trend reversals during day trading. One problem with all these methods is that they identify trend reversals with a time lag. We provide in this paper a novel approach to predict such sharp reversals by using machine learning algorithms. We analyze past and present data to predict intraday trend reversals in the index with precision and robustness. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2021.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089242976
"Richard, Heryadi Y., Lukas, Trisetyarso A.",Leverage from Blockchain in Commodity Exchange: Asset-Backed Token with Ethereum Blockchain Network and Smart Contract,2020.0,Asset-backed token; Blockchain; ERC-20; Ethereum; Token,"Ethereum is one of the most popular blockchain platforms with a high number of adoption in the blockchain world today. Ethereum token (ERC-20) can tokenize any real-world object while it is also possible to exchange the token across the network participants. This utility from the token drives many blockchain enthusiasts to create decentralized applications. ERC-20 token could be used to collect project funds, decision voting, or even can be used to provide investment platforms for people that want to hedge the volatility of the currency with buying an asset that is back to back with the crypto-token. This research shows the main characteristics of asset-backed token and its implementation on a complete end-to-end “digitalization assets system” (assets buy and assets redemption). The result shows that asset-backed token needs support from government and other legalizing parties to verify the legitimacy of the asset that backing the token itself. © 2021, The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089225563

Ivașcu C.-F.,Option pricing using Machine Learning,2020.0,Implied parameters; Machine Learning; Nonparametric methods; Option pricing,"This paper examines the option pricing performance of the most popular Machine Learning algorithms. The classic parametrical models suffer from several limitations in term of computational power required for parametric calibration and unrealistic economical and statistical assumptions. Therefore, a data driven approach based on non-parametric models is are well justified. Most of the previous researchers focus especially on the neural networks method (NN), the other algorithms being unexplored. Beside NN, this paper also analyses the performance of the Support Vector Regressions and Genetic Algorithms and propose three other Decision Tree methods, respectively Random Forest, XGBoost and LightGMB. In order to emphasize the power of this algorithms, a comparison with classical methods like Black-Scholes and Corrado-Su with both historical and implied parameters have been conducted. The analyzes were performed on European call options who have as underlying asset the WTI crude oil future contracts. Machine Learning algorithms outperform by a great margin the classical approaches regardless of the moneyness and the maturity of the contracts. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85088912136
Mermer A.,"Design, synthesize and antiurease activity of novel thiazole derivatives: Machine learning, molecular docking and biological investigation",2020.0,Antiurease activity; Machine learning; Molecular docking; OCHEM; Thiazole,"Machine learning is one of the methods used in the design of new molecules with different biological properties and has become a trend in recent years. Since there are many published studies on urease enzyme inhibition, we accumulated a huge literatüre data set and improved a model for antiurease activity. The balanced accuracy of the selected compounds (classification models) were about 78% and the predictive accuracy of them possessed a coefficient of determination q2 = 0.2-0.7 (regression models) with cross-validation and independent test sets. Thanks to the chemical library created with the machine learning method, a comparison of the predictive and experimental results of the compounds that previously synthesized by us and investigated urease inhibition was made. Compounds observed to be experimentally active were found to be active with the machine learning method. The models are freely avaible online (http://ochem.eu) and can be used to predict potantial antiurease activity of novel compounds. The activity potentials of compounds 4a-d were further evaluated via molecular docking studies with AutoDock4 and AutoDock Vina softwares. © 2020",Article,2-s2.0-85088633147

The risks born out of these IoT systems cannot easily fit into an existing risk framework. There are many cybersecurity risk assessment approaches and frameworks that are under deployment in many governmental and commercial organizations. Extending these existing frameworks to IoT systems alone will not address the new risks that have arisen in the IoT ecosystem. This study has included a review of existing popular cyber risk assessment methodologies and their suitability to IoT systems. National Institute of Standards and Technology, Operationally Critical Threat, Asset, and Vulnerability Evaluation, Threat Assessment & Remediation Analysis, and International Standards Organization are the four main frameworks critically analyzed in this research study. IoT risks are presented and reviewed in terms of the IoT risk category and impacted industries. IoT systems in financial technology and healthcare are dealt with in detail, given their high-risk exposure. Risk vectors for IoT and the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) are discussed in this study. A unique risk ranking method to rank and quantify IoT risk is introduced in this study. This ranking method initiates a risk assessment approach exclusively for IoT systems by quantifying IoT risk vectors, leading to effective risk mitigation strategies and techniques. A unique computational approach to calculate the cyber risk for IoT systems with IoT-specific impact factors has been designed and explained in the context of IoMT systems. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85085376319

The most notable application of blockchain is in the development and operation of cryptocurrencies (e.g. bitcoin, ethereum, among others). Besides the financial services industry, blockchain is also considered in other sectors such as international trade, taxation, supply chain management, business operations and governance. However, blockchain has not been examined comprehensively in all areas of relevant literature. This article conducts a survey of the literature to gain an understanding of the opportunities and issues presented by blockchain in various business functions. The article begins by providing a discussion regarding how the blockchain technology operates. The paper takes a broad focus in its analysis of the prospects of blockchain for various business functions, including banking and the capital markets, corporate governance, international trade, and taxation. The paper demonstrates how organisations and regulators can leverage blockchain to upscale business operations, enhance efficiency and reduce operational costs. The key drawbacks of blockchain that stakeholders need to bear in mind before adopting the technology are also highlighted. The article also reflects on how organisations can tap into blockchain to reap the full potential of the fourth industrial revolution. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85089898912
"Petri I., Barati M., Rezgui Y., Rana O.F.",Blockchain for energy sharing and trading in distributed prosumer communities,2020.0,Blockchain; Cost; Energy communities; Fish industries; Smart contracts,"The decentralisation of energy supply and demand can contribute decisively to protecting the environment and climate of the planet by consuming electricity in the proximity of the generation source and avoiding losses in transmission and distribution. Supporting energy transactions with emerging intelligent technologies can advance the development of energy communities and accelerate the integration of renewable sources. Distributed energy solutions play an essential role as they are explicitly designed to produce, store and deliver green energy. Profiting with these benefits is essential, especially in the context of the current debate on stopping climate change. Several technologies such as waste heat recovery with intelligent algorithms can improve the energy distribution and provide significant resource savings. On the other hand, the usage of Blockchain technology in energy markets promises to incentivise the use of renewables and provide a reliable framework to monitor real-time information of energy production and consumption. Blockchain can also enable trading between independent agents and lead to the formation of more secured energy communities. In this paper, we demonstrate how Blockchain can be utilised to support the formation and use of energy communities. We propose a Blockchain-based energy framework as a mean to support energy exchanges in a community of prosumers. We demonstrate how smart contracts can manage energy transactions and enable a more secured trading environment between consumers and producers. We utilise data and models from a real fish processing industrial site in Milford Haven Port, South Wales, based on which we validate our research hypothesis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85089433043
"Ren Y., Zhao Q., Guan H., Lin Z.",A novel authentication scheme based on edge computing for blockchain-based distributed energy trading system,2020.0,Authentication scheme; Blockchain; Consensus; Edge computing; Energy trading system,"Distributed energy trading system is a new business model of energy industry. Applying blockchain technology, energy supply contracts can be communicated directly between producers and consumers. However, blockchain is without any identity authentication and legitimate user identities are possibly forged if there is not any user identity authentication procedure in a trading system. In this paper, we design an authentication scheme for blockchain-based energy trading systems by using edge computing, including journalizing processes, registration, and identity authentication. In our scheme, each node has computing power, which can ensure the meter data can be processed locally or on the edge. In addition, the correctness and security analysis of the scheme are also given in this paper. The analysis shows that our scheme is unforgeability and can protect users’ privacy. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85088981469

We use the daily returns from the Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) 50 and China Security Index (CSI) 300 Index in the Chinese stock market to compare both standard linear methods (ordinary least squares, stepwise regression, principal components regression (PCR), elastic net (ENet)) and deep learning neural network (NN) methods with one, two, and three hidden layers (NN1, NN2, and NN3, respectively) from January 2012 to December 2017. We show that for both SSE 50 and CSI 300 indices, not all NN models outperform linear models in terms of out-out-of-sample Roos2 values in the 2017 test dataset. However, the NN models with one and three hidden layers do not outperform the classical PCR model in terms of out-of-sample Ros2 values for the SSE 50 Index, whereas all the deep learning methods outperform the traditional models for the CSI 300 Index. The NN model with two hidden layers performs the best in terms of the out-out-of-sample R2 values for the CSI 300 Index.

Pooley H.,Why banks are missing an opportunity to capture the lucrative small and medium enterprise market,2020.0,Banking; FinTech; Payments; Small and medium enter-prises; SMEs,"This paper provides insight into the current small and medium enterprise (SME) and banking landscapes, exploring the challenges both face, and the strained relationship between the two, before advising on methods through which this relationship could be improved. The paper goes on to explore how FinTech firms could play an instrumental role in the evolving rela-tionships between banks and SMEs, and then outlines four routes that banks could explore to take advantage of this highly lucrative market sector: invest in their own FinTech; develop their own technology; partner with FinTechs; or build an open banking ecosystem. The paper concludes that banks tend to take a pragmatic approach to problem-solving so are likely to use a combina-tion of the proposed solutions and enlist the help of multiple providers. In this way, banks will be able to capitalise on the opportunities associated with SMEs and keep up with the rapid pace of change within both the banking industry and society as a whole. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Article,2-s2.0-85079060981
"Alaassar A., Mention A.-L., Aas T.H.",Exploring how social interactions influence regulators and innovators: The case of regulatory sandboxes,2020.0,Entrepreneurial finance; Financial technology (FinTech); Incubation model; Regulator-regulatee social interaction; Regulatory sandbox,"Like incubators, regulatory sandboxes constitute a prominent mechanism to enable entrepreneurial activities that guide financial technology (FinTech) firms through regulatory frameworks in the financial industry. Because they are new, there is a lack of research on regulatory sandboxes; most studies have investigated legal aspects while overlooking the management perspective. To address this gap, this paper builds on incubation research studies to explore how social interactions within regulatory sandboxes influence the practices of regulators and regulatees, using social capital theory. An exploratory-abductive approach is adopted, using data collected from 16 semi-structured interviews. The findings indicate that regulator-regulatee social interactions increase the legitimacy, risk management capabilities, and knowledge of regulatory frameworks among regulatees and, as to regulators, increase their understanding of regulatory constraints and potential risks in enabling technologies, better inform them of regulatees’ support needs, and offer them early access to regulatory innovations. The findings also reveal that the practices of regulators and regulatees may be negatively affected due to lowered trust and discrepancies in expectations and underlying goals. This research contributes to the incubation literature by focusing on the micro and meso levels of knowledge exchange and the entrepreneurial finance literature by promoting the role of incubation models. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,2-s2.0-85089574443
"Chalvatzis C., Hristu-Varsakelis D.",High-performance stock index trading via neural networks and trees,2020.0,Automatic trading; Deep learning; Finance; LSTM; Stock prediction,"Automated asset trading typically involves a price prediction model – of as high an accuracy as possible – together with a trading strategy, sometimes as simple as buying or selling when the price is predicted to rise or fall, respectively. Despite the fact that the model's effectiveness in generating profits may depend on the particular trading strategy it is used with, these two components are often designed separately, in part because of the difficulty involved in jointly optimizing them. Motivated by this interplay between model performance and trading strategy, this work presents a novel automated trading architecture in which the prediction model is tuned to enhance profitability instead of accuracy, while the trading strategy attempts to be more sophisticated in its use of the model's price predictions. In particular, instead of acting simply on whether the price is predicted to rise or fall we show that there is value in taking advantage of the model-specific distribution of predicted returns, and the fact that a prediction's position within that distribution carries useful information about the expected profitability of a trade. Our proposed approach was tested with tree-based models as well as one deep long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, all of which were kept structurally simple and generated predictions based on price observations over a modest number of trading days. Tested over the period 2010–2019 on the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA), NASDAQ and Russell 2000 stock indices, and our best overall model achieved cumulative returns of 350%, 403%, 497% and 333%, respectively, outperforming the benchmark buy-and-hold strategy as well as other recent efforts. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Review,2-s2.0-85088902625
Yuen T.H.,"PAChain: Private, authenticated & auditable consortium blockchain and its implementation",2020.0,Blockchain; Privacy,"Blockchain provides a distributed ledger recording a globally agreed, immutable transaction history, which may not be suitable for Fintech applications that process sensitive information. This paper aims to solve three important problems for practical blockchain applications: privacy, authentication and auditability. Private transaction means that the transaction can be validated without revealing the transaction details, such as the identity of the transacting parties and the transaction amount. Auditable transaction means that the complete transaction details can be revealed by auditors or law enforcement agencies. Authenticated transaction means that only authorized parties can be involved in the transaction. Auditability prevents a malicious user from abusing the privacy property. Authenticity helps the auditor to trace the identity of the malicious user in the system. In this paper, we present a private, authenticated and auditable consortium blockchain, using a number of cryptographic building blocks. Our scheme can be integrated with the architecture of consortium blockchain. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85087104248

Based on the stock returns of U.S. financial and FinTech institutions, we estimate pairwise risk spillovers by using the Granger causality test across quantiles. We consider the whole distribution: the left tail (bearish case), the right tail (bullish case) and the center of the distribution and construct three types of spillover networks (downside-to-downside, upside-to-upside, and center-to-center) and obtain network-based spillover indicators. We find that linkages in the network are stronger in the bearish case when the risk of spillover is higher. FinTech institutions' risk spillover to financial institutions positively correlates with financial institutions' increase in systemic risk. These results have important policy implications, as they underscore the importance of enhancing the supervision and regulation of FinTech companies, to maintain financial stability. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85087340953
"Abdullah N., Redzuan F., Daud N.A.",E-wallet: Factors influencing user acceptance towards cashless society in Malaysia among public universities,2020.0,Cashless society e-wallet,"The evolution of financial technology into digital payment has led to a new era of cashless society. In line with the global trend, the Malaysian Government has been committed to strengthen the agenda of a cashless society by actively promoting the use of e-Wallet through the establishment of the Interoperable Credit Transfer Framework (ICTF) policy in 2018. Although e-Wallet has been implemented since 2016, several previous studies have found that the level of acceptance is still relatively low while the main factors that influence the acceptance of e-Wallet in Malaysia still remain unclear. This study aims to identify the factors that influence the acceptance of e-Wallet towards establishing cashless society in Malaysia. Online survey using closed-ended questionnaires have been conducted among 400 respondents from students and employees of Malaysian public universities in Klang Valley. Collected data have been analyzed using descriptive statistics and inferential statistics which consist of Factor Analysis, Pearson Correlation and Multiple Linear Regression in Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS). Based on the findings, four factors are found to significantly influence e-wallet acceptance, which consist of Performance Expectancy (PE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC) and Trust (T).

The main objective of the study is to determine the impact of PSD2 on the number of newly established PayTech companies. The second objective is to explain the factors driving the distribution of PSD2-licensed entities across the European Union countries. The difference-in-difference method and the Poisson regression model served our empirical analysis. The results show that the adoption of PSD2 in November 2015 caused a rapid but temporary surge in PayTech start-ups in Europe. After national transpositions of the directive, the number of new entrants fell in 2018; however, it remained at a higher level than before the adoption of PSD2, which indicates its positive impact. The analysis has proved that market potential, the characteristics of payment systems, including the popularity of payment cards, and the public environment for FinTech start-ups provided by the authorities significantly affected the number of PSD2 licences issued. The introduction of the PSD2 has made the size of the domestic market play a smaller role, as PayTechs can operate on a pan-European level also while based in a smaller country. The importance of an open business environment has increased and offering regulatory sandboxes has proven to effectively support the development of the PayTech sector. © 2020 The Author(s)",Article,2-s2.0-85089414178

Evidence from China,2020.0,Bank FinTech; China; Commercial banks; Credit risk,"Using data from Chinese commercial banks between 2008 and 2017, this paper explores the effects of bank FinTech on credit risk. We first construct and measure a bank FinTech index using web crawler technology and word frequency analysis. The results show that the development of bank FinTech is faster in state-owned banks than in other banks. Moreover, among the five subareas of bank FinTech, the development of internet technology is ahead of artificial intelligence technology, blockchain technology, cloud computing technology, and big data technology. Then, the impacts of bank FinTech on credit risk are examined. We find that bank FinTech significantly reduces credit risk in Chinese commercial banks, and further analyses show that the negative effects of bank FinTech on credit risk are relatively weak among large banks, state-owned banks, and listed banks. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85089013293
"Tanwar S., Kaneriya S., Kumar N., Zeadally S.",ElectroBlocks: A blockchain-based energy trading scheme for smart grid systems,2020.0,blockchain; network management; performance evaluation; smart grid,"Smart grid systems are widely used across the world for providing demand response management between users and service providers. In most of the energy distributions scenarios, the traditional grid systems use the centralized architecture, which results in large transmission losses and high overheads during power generation. Moreover, owing to the presence of intruders or attackers, there may be a mismatch between demand and supply between utility centers (suppliers) and end users. Thus, there is a need for an automated energy exchange to provide secure and reliable energy trading between users and suppliers. We found, from the existing literature, that blockchain can be an effective solution to handle the aforementioned issues. Motivated by these facts, we propose a blockchain-based smart energy trading scheme, ElectroBlocks, which provides efficient mechanisms for secure energy exchanges between users and service providers. In ElectroBlocks, nodes in the network validate the transaction using two algorithms that are cost aware and store aware. The cost-aware algorithm locates the nearest node that can supply the energy, whereas the store-aware algorithm ensures that the energy requests go to the node with the lowest storage space. We evaluated the performance of the ElectroBlocks using performance metrics such as mining delay, network exchanges, and storage energy. The simulation results obtained demonstrate that ElectroBlocks maintains a secure trade-off between users and service providers when using the proposed cost-aware and store-aware algorithms. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",Article,2-s2.0-85088782593

Using daily data from 2017 to 2020, we employ tail dependence as copulas and the Generalized Forecast Error Variance Decomposition to examine the volatility connectedness. Our results suggest that, first, portfolios consisting of these assets exhibit heavy-tail dependence which implies that in the times of economic turbulence, there will be a high probability of large joint losses. Second, volatility transmission is higher in the short term, implying that short-term shocks can cause higher volatility in the assets, but in the long run, volatility transmission decreases. Third, Bitcoin and gold are vital assets for hedging, though the Bitcoin is also affected by its past volatility, a feature it shares with green bonds and NASDAQ AI. During economic downturns, gold may act as a safe haven, as its shock transmission to NASDAQ AI is just around 1.41%. Lastly, the total volatility transmission of all financial assets is considerably high, suggesting that the portfolio has an inherent self-transmitting risk which requires careful diversification. The NASDAQ AI and general equity indexes are not good hedging instruments for each other. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85087855013

Existing research works utilize a utility company to distribute energy to energy nodes with the help of energy brokers. Afterwards, they apply blockchain to provide transparency, immutability, and auditability of peer-to-peer (P2P) energy trading. However, their schemes are constructed on a weak security model and do not consider the cheating attack initiated by energy sellers. Such an attack refers to an energy seller refusing to transfer the negotiated energy to an energy purchaser who already paid money. In this article, we propose FeneChain, a blockchain-based energy trading scheme to supervise and manage the energy trading process toward building a secure energy trading system and improving energy quality for Industry 4.0. Specifically, we leverage anonymous authentication to protect user privacy, and we design a timed-commitments-based mechanism to guarantee the verifiable fairness during energy trading. Moreover, we utilize fine-grained access control for energy trading services. We also build a consortium blockchain among energy brokers to verify and record energy trading transactions. Finally, we formally analyze the security and privacy of FeneChain and evaluate its performance (i.e., computational costs and communication overhead) by implementing a prototype via a local Ethereum test network and Raspberry Pi. © 2005-2012 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85087802002

They act as a safe haven for deposits and are major sources of credit for households and small- and medium-sized firms. A not-for-profit orientation (in many cases) and a focus on maximising benefits to members have ensured the enduring popularity and sustainability of financial cooperatives. This is particularly evident since the global financial crisis when financial cooperatives continued to extend credit to members as many profit-orientated commercial banks restricted credit to households and firms. The overarching theme of the first part of this review is the structural and behavioural characteristics of financial cooperatives. In this part we consider, the origin and diffusion of financial cooperatives, network arrangements, the business model, relationship banking, balancing the interest of members, tax treatment and regulatory framework. The second part has performance and contribution to the real economy as the overarching theme. In this part we consider, efficiency and sustainability, mergers, acquisitions and failures, the benefits (and challenges) of FinTech and the contribution of financial cooperatives to the real economy including during times of crisis.

The broaden business scope and accelerated goods circulation, nevertheless, have generally led to capital shortages for retailers, especially small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Given the SMEs’ difficulty in acquiring capital from financial institutions such as banks, logistics finance (LF) has emerged as an alternative, which is the combination of logistics and financial service. However, the frequent order fulfillment and diversity of pledges in E-commerce hinder SMEs in meeting LF's financing requirements. Furthermore, the current LF relies more on large and reputable third-party logistics (3PLs) to alleviate financing risks, which in turn raises the entry threshold for other 3PLs. Hence, this paper has proposed a blockchain-enabled logistics finance execution platform (BcLFEP) as an integrated solution to facilitate LF for E-commerce retail. A cross-layered architecture is proposed to organize and manage involved resources, workflows and decisions based on the object-oriented methodology (OOM). A hybrid finite state machine-based smart contract (HFSM-SC) is designed to associate and coordinate with all kinds of agents for LF operations throughout its lifecycle. Moreover, blockchain is integrated with agent technology to construct a blockchain-enabled multi-agent system (BcMAS), providing a trusted runtime environment to more autonomously and efficiently execute smart contract. Finally, a case study is conducted to implement BcLFEP-enabled dynamic pledge management for verification and evaluation. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85082867988

Digital financial inclusion is becoming central in the debate on how to ensure that people who are at the lower levels of the pyramid become financially active. Fintech companies are using AI and its various applications to ensure that the goal of digital financial inclusion is realized that is to ensure that low-income earners, the poor, women, youths, small businesses participate in the mainstream financial market. This study used conceptual and documentary analysis of peer-reviewed journals, reports and other authoritative documents on AI and digital financial inclusion to assess the impact of AI on digital financial inclusion. The present study discovered that AI has a strong influence on digital financial inclusion in areas related to risk detection, measurement and management, addressing the problem of information asymmetry, availing customer support and helpdesk through chatbots and fraud detection and cybersecurity. Therefore, it is recommended that financial institutions and non-financial institutions and governments across the world adopt and scale up the use of AI tools and applications as they present benefits in the quest to ensure that the vulnerable groups of people who are not financially active do participate in the formal financial market with minimum challenges and maximum benefits. © 2020, MDPI Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute.

The trained autoencoder generates a set of latent representations that constitutes a combined -‘communal’- factor to better explains a large portion of the return differences among the stocks in an index. After analyzing all the stocks in S&P-500, Russel-3000, and NASDAQ-100, we found that our proposed latent factor model outperforms many other factor models in predicting the next day's return. Notably, the experiment results show that on average non-communal stocks earn 0.05% over communal stocks. However, the risk associated with this non-communal stock is also 0.8% higher than communal stocks. The experiments confirm that the superior performance comes from the compensation of high risk associated with these non-communal stocks. Investors will benefit from our latent factor model to identify these communal and non-communal stocks for a high return while diversifying their asset portfolio. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85087910977
Omede P.I.,A Tale of Two Markets: How Lower-end Borrowers Are Punished for Bank Regulatory Failures in Nigeria,2020.0,Consumer credit; Emerging markets; Financial regulation; Informal markets; Systemic risk,"In 2009, the Nigerian banking system witnessed a financial crisis caused by elite borrowers in the financial market. Regulatory response to the Nigerian crisis closely mirrored the international response with increased capital and liquidity thresholds for commercial banks. While the rise of consumer protection on the agenda of prudential supervisors internationally was logical in that consumer debt was the main cause of the global recession, the Nigerian banking reforms of 2009 disproportionately affected access by poorer consumers, who ironically had little to do with the underlying causes of the crisis. As lending criteria become more stringent, poorer consumers of credit products are pushed into informal markets because of liquidity-induced credit rationing. Overall, consumer protection is compromised because stronger consumer protection rules for the formal sector benefits borrowers from formal institutions who constitute the minority of borrowers in all markets. While the passage of regulation establishing credit bureaux and the National Collateral Registry will, in theory, ease access to credit especially by lower-end borrowers, the vast size of the informal market continues to compound the information asymmetry problem, fiscal policies to tackle structural economic issues such as unemployment and illiteracy remain to be initiated, and bank regulators continue to pander to elite customers with policy responses that endorse too big to fail but deems lower-end consumers too irrelevant to save. The essay concluded that addressing the wide disparity in access to credit between the rich and poor through property rights reforms to capture the capital of the informal class, promoting regulation to check loan concentration, and stimulating competition by allowing Telecommunication Companies (TELCOs) and fintech companies to carry on lending activities because of their superior knowledge of lower-end markets will facilitate greater access. The risk of systemic failure deriving from consumer credit in Nigeria is insignificant compared to the consumer vulnerabilities resulting from the exposure of consumers to unregulated products in the informal market. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85077167823

This paper concentrates on a less frequently explored area of research by examining the relationships between bank concentration, financial inclusion and SME financing availability respectively, and the interaction between bank concentration and financial inclusion after the implementation of a financial inclusion strategy in China. Design/methodology/approach: Using firm-level data from 1,509 listed SMEs in China from 2007 to 2017 and applying rigorous analyses, we identify how bank concentration affects SME financing availability under the promotion of financial inclusion and also the mechanisms involved. Findings: We find that bank concentration and financial inclusion respectively have positive impacts on the credit available to listed SMEs, indicating that the promotion of financial inclusion in China has reached a new high watermark. The positive impact of bank concentration is reduced when the level of financial inclusion is high. Conversely, a higher level of financial inclusion favours SME credit availability at only a low degree of bank concentration.

Design/methodology/approach: With data collected from 753 fintech users, this study applies partial least square structural equation modeling to compare and select the research model with the most predictive power. Findings: The results show that financial self-efficacy, technological self-efficacy and confirmation positively affect perceived usefulness. Among these factors, financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy have both direct and indirect effects through confirmation on perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness and confirmation are positively related to satisfaction. Finally, perceived usefulness and satisfaction positively influence fintech continuance intentions. Originality/value: To the best of our knowledge, this is one of the earliest studies that investigates the effect of domain-specific self-efficacy on fintech continuance intentions, which enriches the existing research on fintech and deepens our understanding of users' fintech continuance intentions. We distinguish between financial self-efficacy and technological self-efficacy and specify the relationship between self-efficacy and continuance intentions. Moreover, this study highlights the importance of assessing a model's predictive power using the PLSpredict technique and provides a reference for model selection. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85088138937

"Tankha M., Dalinghaus U.",Mapping the intermediate: lived technologies of money and value,2020.0,Intermediaries; monetary technologies; value,"As financial transactions are increasingly digitized, old and new kinds of intermediaries are only expanding in importance. Intermediaries, mediators and brokers sit at critical junctures and operate between diverse financial arenas and pathways. We argue that mapping the intermediate entails identifying how different kinds of actors—human and non-human, objects and interfaces, institutions and practices—delimit or reify but also stitch together and overcome spatial and temporal differences in people's financial lives, while taking on varying burdens of risk. Mapping the intermediate is both an empirical and methodological exercise. Empirically, it requires following the agents and traders, brokers and material objects that facilitate transactions and add, extract, or re-work different kinds of value. Methodologically, intermediaries and the intermediate are not only the objects of analysis but act as analytical tools in their own right, making the process and politics of transactions visible and tangible. Attending to the intermediate in our inquiries around money, currency and new digital financial technologies, thereby, offers new directions for grounding finance in politics and history and better connecting micro and macro and local and global economic processes. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Editorial,2-s2.0-85087350767

Regulatory responses and support are essential, requiring significant changes to current regulatory practices. Due to their limited technical knowledge and financial technology resources, regulators worked with industry to overcome these challenges. Such collaborations are scarce. This study proposes a model for mobile money collaborative regulatory development. Actual practices were mapped with negotiated rulemaking theory to derive variations and extensions to the original theory. Regulators appointed a discussion committee with broader representation for objective decisions. Throughout the negotiation process, the central bank maintained close control; participants are motivated to compromise their interests to achieve joint gains. Findings reveal that collaboration gave participants the necessary knowledge and information to develop effective regulation. The central bank composed the executable rule through collaboration. Subsequent revisions are also key to regulatory development. These revisions were developed with stakeholder involvement as suggestions and comments. Mobility regulation also observes collaborative testing and benchmarking. Specialized subcommittees will further improve the negotiation process. © 2020 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85077873252

The application of new financial technologies is likely to accelerate, affecting retail banking in particular, but will not necessarily be led by FinTech firms. Local and regional financial centres are likely to face larger challenges than leading international centres.

Truby J.,Governing Artificial Intelligence to benefit the UN Sustainable Development Goals,2020.0,Artificial intelligence; Big Tech; black box; financial inclusion; financial technology; regulation; SDGs; sustainable development; technology governance,"Big Tech's unregulated roll-out out of experimental AI poses risks to the achievement of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), with particular vulnerability for developing countries. The goal of financial inclusion is threatened by the imperfect and ungoverned design and implementation of AI decision-making software making important financial decisions affecting customers. Automated decision-making algorithms have displayed evidence of bias, lack ethical governance, and limit transparency in the basis for their decisions, causing unfair outcomes and amplify unequal access to finance. Poverty reduction and sustainable development targets are risked by Big Tech's potential exploitation of developing countries by using AI to harvest data and profits. Stakeholder progress toward preventing financial crime and corruption is further threatened by potential misuse of AI. In the light of such risks, Big Tech's unscrupulous history means it cannot be trusted to operate without regulatory oversight. The article proposes effective pre-emptive regulatory options to minimize scenarios of AI damaging the SDGs. It explores internationally accepted principles of AI governance, and argues for their implementation as regulatory requirements governing AI developers and coders, with compliance verified through algorithmic auditing. Furthermore, it argues that AI governance frameworks must require a benefit to the SDGs. The article argues that proactively predicting such problems can enable continued AI innovation through well-designed regulations adhering to international principles. It highlights risks of unregulated AI causing harm to human interests, where a public and regulatory backlash may result in over-regulation that could damage the otherwise beneficial development of AI. © 2020 The Authors.

Aiming at promoting efficient cooperation in data market for big data, in this paper we propose a novel cooperative data purchase framework, by leveraging the power of the data user crowd and their intrinsic trustworthy collaboration relationships. For achieving efficient cooperative data purchase, we develop a comprehensive approach consisting of both data purchase group formation and selection. For the data purchase group formation, we partition the users into multiple data purchase groups for the purpose of budget pooling, by taking into account their data interest and budget levels, meanwhile respecting their underlying collaboration relationships and the maximum allowable group size for data sharing enforced by the data market platform. For the data purchase group selection, we construct a data purchase flow network formulation and devise a minimum cut based solution for selecting the proper set of data purchase groups to fully support their demands subject to the budget constraints. We extensively evaluate the performance of cooperative data purchase framework using both Erdos-Renyi and scale-free collaboration graphs. The numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework can achieve superior performance, with more than 40\% and 100\% performance gain over the case without cooperation in terms of the total received payment and the number of satisfied users, respectively. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85088586331

However, the driving endurance of the electric vehicle is the biggest shortage that hinders the fully acceptance of this new vehicle technology. To deal with this shortage, this paper proposed a vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) electricity trading scheme based on Bayesian game pricing in blockchain-enabled Internet of vehicles (BIoV). Specifically, the Bayesian game is adopted for pricing in the distributed BIoV with incomplete information sharing. The optimal pricing under the linear strategic equilibrium has been obtained which maximizes the utilities of both sides of electricity transaction. The transaction volume is determined from the formulated convex problem that maximizes the social welfare. Then, the pricing game is implemented by the dedicated smart contract. Blockchain guarantees its trustworthiness, security, and reliability. Finally, the experimental results show that referring to the benchmark of static game with complete information, the proposed Bayesian game with incomplete information can achieve approximate satisfaction of users. The degree of approximation can reach to 98% when the pricing ranges of buyers and sellers are close. Moreover, the proposed scheme has great advantages over the static game with complete information in terms of communication overhead and timeliness in the decentralized IoVs. © 1967-2012 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85088536450

While speculators seek to profit from extrapolating the price trends, tech-savvy investors trade based on the prospective value of Bitcoin, which is a function of factors that capture the market demand and technical supply of Bitcoin. Estimating the structural model, we find the coexistence of speculators and tech-savvy investors in the Bitcoin market. We further show that, regardless of the market states, tech-savvy investors consistently buy (sell) Bitcoin when its price goes below (above) the prospective value. However, speculators follow a momentum trading strategy in the high-market-volatility regime and switch to a contrarian strategy in the low-market-volatility regime. Our finding suggests that a significant fraction of tech-savvy investors value the potential of Bitcoin as an innovative technology.

Various reports have touted P2P energy markets as ideal use case for blockchain-technology, as it offers advantages such as fault-tolerant operation, trust delegation, immutability, transparency, resilience, and automation. However, relatively little is known about the influence of hardware and communication infrastructure limitations on blockchain systems in real-life applications. In this article, we demonstrate the implementation of a real-world blockchain managed microgrid in Walenstadt, Switzerland. The 37 participating households are equipped with 75 special smart-metres that include single board computers (SBC) that run their own, application-specific private blockchain. Using the field-test setup, we provide an empirical evaluation of the feasibility of a Byzantine fault tolerant blockchain system. Furthermore, we artificially throttle bandwidth between nodes to simulate how the bandwidth of communication infrastructure impacts its performance. We find that communication networks with a bandwidth smaller than 1000 kbit/s – which includes WPAN, LoRa, narrowband IoT, and narrowband PLC – lead to insufficient throughput of the operation of a blockchain-managed microgrid. While larger numbers of validators may provide higher decentralisation and fault-tolerant operation, they considerably reduce throughput. The results from the field-test in the Walenstadt microgrid show that the blockchain running on the smart-metre SBCs can provide a maximum throughput of 10 transactions per second. The blockchain throughput halts almost entirely if the system is run by more than 40 validators. Based on the field test, we provide simplified guidelines for utilities or grid operators interested in implementing local P2P markets based on BFT systems. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85086070578

"Flögel F., Beckamp M.",Will FinTech make regional banks superfluous for small firm finance? Observations from soft information-based lending in Germany,2020.0,FinTech; peer-to-peer lending; regional banks; relationship banking; small firm finance; soft information,"Regional banks have a competitive advantage in that short distances to clients enable the use of soft information for superior lending decisions. If the ambition of FinTech start-ups to create superior screening and monitoring technologies materialises, this advantage would be diminished and regional banks would become superfluous for small firm finance. To explore this claim, the paper in hand analyses qualitative empirical data about the lending processes and rating system use of regional German savings banks. In essence, the results from participant observation and interviews clarify the importance of “real” soft information for critical lending decisions. The context specificity and limited verifiability of “real” soft information hamper it from being hardened through the use of rating systems and other bank-ICT. Though FinTech's scoring technologies may overcome the first limitation, it appears likely that in the course of scoring development “real” soft information will be systematically crowded out due to the manipulation problem. The paper expects improved access to finance for SMEs if FinTech solutions overcome both limitations of “real” soft information use, or if peer-to-peer lending and regional banks coexist. Deteriorated access to finance is expected if FinTech companies displace the relationship banking of regional banks due to enhanced competition, without preserving the advantages of “real” soft information with superior screening and monitoring technologies. The paper concludes with recommendations on how to prevent deteriorated access to finance for small firms by promoting fair competition and FinTech innovations. © 2019 John Wiley & Sons Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85076357095

Bitcoin has emerged as a new alternative investment for investors which has attracted much attention from the media and investors alike.

Specially, we employ data up to June 2018 and analyse the potential out-of-sample portfolio benefits resulting from including Bitcoin in a stock-bond portfolio for a range of eight popular asset allocation strategies. The out-of-sample analysis shows that, across all different asset allocation strategies and risk aversions, the benefits of Bitcoin are quite considerable with substantially higher risk-adjusted returns. Our results are robust to rolling estimation windows, the incorporation of transaction costs, the inclusion of a commodity portfolio, alternative indices, short-selling as well as two additional optimization techniques including higher moments with (and without) variance-based constraints (VBCs). Therefore, our results suggest that investors should include Bitcoin in their portfolio as it generates substantial higher risk-adjusted returns. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85069954219

Traditional machine learning models, e.g., logistic regression (LR), are easy to interpret in nature. However, many of these models aggregate time-series data without considering the temporal correlations and variations. Therefore, their performance cannot match up to recurrent neural network (RNN) based models, which are nonetheless difficult to interpret. In this paper, we propose a general framework TRACER to facilitate accurate and interpretable predictions, with a novel model TITV devised for healthcare analytics and other high stakes applications such as financial investment and risk management. Different from LR and other existing RNN-based models, TITV is designed to capture both the time-invariant and the time-variant feature importance using a feature-wise transformation subnetwork and a self-attention subnetwork, for the feature influence shared over the entire time series and the time-related importance respectively. Healthcare analytics is adopted as a driving use case, and we note that the proposed TRACER is also applicable to other domains, e.g., fintech. We evaluate the accuracy of TRACER extensively in two real-world hospital datasets, and our doctors/clinicians further validate the interpretability of TRACER in both the patient level and the feature level. Besides, TRACER is also validated in a critical financial application. The experimental results confirm that TRACER facilitates both accurate and interpretable analytics for high stakes applications. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85086249443

Dattani K.,“Governtrepreneurism” for good governance: The case of Aadhaar and the India Stack,2020.0,Aadhaar; biometric technology; citizenship; financial technology; governmentality; India Stack,"In many of the ex-colonies of European empires, biometric technology systems are being built under an ethos of welfare and financial service delivery. One case in this broader trend of postcolonial governance is India's Aadhaar and India Stack. This paper uses this case to explore how the in-sourcing of technology into means of governing, behind a front of participatory “good governance,” is contributing to the historical trajectory of citizenship regimes in India. Through claims of reducing financial “leakages,” Aadhaar, a biometric identification database consisting of fingerprint, iris scan, and photograph, has become compulsory for accessing welfare in India. The Indian government makes a case for Aadhaar using a propaganda discourse of its success, based on weak evidence. The India Stack, a set of cloud-based application programming interfaces (APIs) built on top of the Aadhaar database, offers a digital infrastructure for private companies to verify identities using Aadhaar data and to offer other “services” including “financial services.” The ability to access data, paired with a “revolving door” of individuals between state and corporations, points to an ulterior goal of both Aadhaar and the India Stack: creating winners in the corporate and financial technology sectors. The Indian corporate-state run through a “governtrepreneurism” uses Aadhaar and the India Stack as new digital technologies of governmentality to transform populations into subjects or customers. © 2019 The Author.

The emotion of investors has an effect on stock returns, which is a hot topic in behavioral finance. Blockchain is an essential part of FinTech, and with the fast development of this technology, investors' sentiment varies as well. The online information that directly reflects investors' mood could be utilized for mining and quantifying to construct a sentiment index. For a better understanding of how well some factors adequately explain the return of stocks related to blockchain companies in the Chinese stock market, the Fama-French three-factor model (FFTFM) will be introduced in this paper. Furthermore, sentiment could be a new independent variable to enhance the explanatory power of the FFTFM. A comparison between those two models reveals that the sentiment factor could raise the explanatory power. The results also indicate that the Chinses blockchain industry does not own the size effect and book-to-market effect. © 2020 by the authors.",Article,2-s2.0-85087175087

By studying five ventures in a nascent financial-technology market, we develop a novel theoretical framework for understanding how entrepreneurs effectively design business models: parallel play. Similar to parallel play by preschoolers, entrepreneurs engaged in parallel play interweave action, cognition, and timing to accelerate learning about a novel world. Specifically, they (1) borrow from peers and focus on established substitutes for their services or products, (2) test assumptions, then commit to a broad business-model template, and (3) pause before elaborating the activity system. The insights from our framework contribute to research on optimal distinctiveness and to the learning and evolutionary-adjustment literatures. More broadly, we blend organization theory with a fresh theoretical lens—business-model processes—to highlight how organizations actually work and create value. © The Author(s) 2019.",Article,2-s2.0-85083797203

Initially driven by the research community, standardization bodies as 3GPP have embraced it as a promising solution to revolutionize the traditional mobile telecommunication market by enabling new business models opportunities. Network Slicing is envisioned to open up the telecom market to new players such as Industry Verticals, e.g., automotive, smart factories, e-health, etc. Given the large number of potential new business players, dubbed as network tenants, novel solutions are required to accommodate their needs in a cost-efficient and secure manner. In this paper, we propose NSBchain, a novel network slicing brokering (NSB) solution, which leverages on the widely adopted Blockchain technology to address the new business models needs beyond traditional network sharing agreements. NSBchain defines a new entity, the Intermediate Broker (IB), which enables Infrastructure Providers (InPs) to allocate network resources to IBs through smart contracts and IBs to assign and re-distribute their resources among tenants in a secure, automated and scalable manner. We conducted an extensive performance evaluation by means of an open-source blockchain platform that proves the feasibility of our proposed framework considering a large number of tenants and two different consensus algorithms. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089415021

Therefore, the P2P energy market platform needs more precise design to ensure that the feedback effect between the transmission and distribution system operation will not reduce the system stability. At the same time, the trading mechanism needs to be redesigned, allowing the platform owner to maximize their own interests by setting prices. Blockchain technology is used to create a shared electric vehicle trading platform, which allows electric vehicles to communicate with the smart grid. The main focus of this paper is to design the combination of blockchain technology and electric vehicles. Blockchain technology has the characteristics of decentralization, distributed peer-to-peer, non-tamperable, consensus trust and economy. From the perspective of feature matching, it can be found that the advantage of the blockchain is actually complementary to the demand of the electric vehicle charging and generating transaction. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85088594458

Investment in the stock market has a big risk associated with it. Minimizing prediction error reduces the investment risk. Machine learning (ML) models typically perform better than statistical and econometric models. Also, ensemble ML models have been shown in the literature to be able to produce superior performance than single ML models. In this work, we compare the eectiveness of tree-based ensemble ML models (Random Forest (RF), XGBoost Classifier (XG), Bagging Classifier (BC), AdaBoost Classifier (Ada), Extra Trees Classifier (ET), and Voting Classifier (VC) in forecasting the direction of stock price movement. Eight dierent stock data from three stock exchanges (NYSE, NASDAQ, and NSE) are randomly collected and used for the study. Each data set is split into training and test set. Ten-fold cross validation accuracy is used to evaluate the ML models on the training set. In addition, the ML models are evaluated on the test set using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, specificity, and area under receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC-ROC). Kendall W test of concordance is used to rank the performance of the tree-based ML algorithms. For the training set, the AdaBoost model performed better than the rest of the models.

To overcome regulatory barriers of the fintech industry, regulatory sandboxes have been adopted. The regulatory sandboxes are beneficial to create a fintech ecosystem, but their effectiveness has not been empirically supported. This study aims to find the expected effects of regulatory sandboxes on fintech venture investments empirically. We conducted an analysis using a country-level comparative research method. To analyze it, we selected nine forerunning countries which have initially adopted regulatory sandboxes. For the purpose of validations, a comparative analysis and a regression analysis were conducted. In the results, we found that the adoption of regulatory sandboxes had very positive influences on the growth of the fintech venture investment. The results implied that regulatory sandboxes may play a vital role in increasing the influx of venture capital into the fintech venture ecosystem by removing regulatory uncertainty.

While the characteristics of cryptoassets, such as anonymity and disintermediation in transactions, bring significant benefits, they come with a range of significant risks concerning investor protection and market integrity. Due to the difficulties in regulating cryptoassets under the traditional framework, Hong Kong has set up its first comprehensive regulatory regime on cryptoassets in November 2018, imposing new standards on cryptoasset fund managers, distributors and platform operators. By means of a comparison with four major jurisdictions overseas, including Mainland China, the US, the UK, and Singapore, the strengths and potential concerns of Hong Kong’s new regime are analysed. Overall, the new regulatory regime for cryptoassets in Hong Kong is a significant development, addressing the issues of regulatory gaps and regulatory arbitrage that existed under the previous framework as well as introducing enhanced regulatory standards. This has the effect of improving investor protection, but there are some remaining concerns. Chief amongst them are the problems with regulatory scope, the application of traditional regulatory standards to cryptoassets that do not fall within the definition of securities or futures, problems with the sandbox mechanism, and ultimately as a matter of regulatory philosophy, the need for a better balance between investor protection and market development. © 2020, T.M.C.

The prevailing belief is that digital banking has several advantages, such as lower costs and higher information transferability for customers. These benefits can also promote competition between banks given customers' predilection for “multi-homing,” or engagement with multiple banks. This study investigated the impact of customers' digital banking adoption on hidden defection, in which customers purchase financial products from competing banks instead of their primary banks. To this end, we developed an analytical model to provide insights into the effects of digital banking adoption while taking customers' multi-homing behaviors into consideration. We then conducted a series of empirical analyses using comprehensive individual-level transaction data to provide evidence of hidden defection. Our findings indicate that customers with higher loyalty exhibit greater hidden defection after digital banking adoption. Customers who engage primarily with personal-service channels (e.g., branches) show stronger hidden defection than do self-service channel (e.g., ATMs) users, and this effect is more prevalent among loyal customers. Our results provide valuable implications for omni-channel services in a market characterized by multi-homing behavior of customers. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85075486028

Thus, this study aims to establish the mediating effect of digital consumer protection in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion with data collected from micro small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in northern Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: To achieve the main objective of this study, a research model was developed to test for the mediating effect of digital consumer protection in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. The data were collected from MSMEs and structural equation modelling in partial least square (PLS) combined with bootstrap was applied to analyze and test the hypotheses of this study. The direct and indirect effect of mobile money adoption and usage on financial inclusion was tested through digital consumer protection as a mediator variable. Findings: The findings from the PLS-structural equation modelling (SEM) showed that mobile money adoption and usage has both direct and indirect effect on financial inclusion. Moreover, financial inclusion is influenced by both mobile money adoption and usage and digital consumer protection. Research limitations/implications: The study used partial least square (PLS-SEM) combined with bootstrap confidence intervals through a formative approach to establish the mediating effect of the mediator variable. Hence, it ignored the use of covariance-based SEM and the MedGraph programme. Furthermore, data were collected from samples located in Gulu district, northern Uganda and specifically from MSMEs. This limits generalization of the study findings to other population who also use mobile money services. Practical implications: Promoters of digital financial services, managers of telecommunication companies, and financial inclusion advocates should consider strengthening the existing digital consumer protection laws on the mobile money platform. A collaborative approach between the mobile network operators, financial institutions and regulators should tighten the existing laws against mobile money fraudsters and an efficient mechanism for recourse, compensation and remedy should be set up to benefit the victims of frauds and cybercrime on the Fintech ecosystem.

They serve as effective hedging tools and improve economic development, but conversely are complicated and subject to heavy regulation. Decentralized Ledger Technology (DLT) enables a distributed, trustworthy ledger that stores encrypted information. It could enable frictionless, transparent, financial derivative processing by creating an inherently trustworthy ecosystem that eliminates the need for transaction verification. This paper discusses how different DLT protocols could facilitate financial derivatives. We then present a protocol for facilitating financial derivatives using Stellar's DLT protocol. Assessing our protocol shows that it processes derivatives efficiently with complete transparency. Comparing our DLT based derivatives to traditional derivatives affirms our belief that DLT enables an increase in transparency and reduction of market friction. However, we also found that DLT based derivatives have increased security and counterparty risk. Overall, if the developer mitigates the risks associated with DLT, our protocol could enable a level 3 blockchain application to improve the financial derivatives ecosystem significantly. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089228102

Open innovation between critical stakeholders in the emerging fintech industry brings about positive results to improve financing needs of this huge segment of the market that ranges from those underserved by banks because of credit risk, to migrants and refugees. Despite the introduction of disruptive fintech services, the needs generated by unimproved conditions and protracted crises outstrip the resources available to meet them. Islamic fintech has the potential to solve this problem through its mandatory (zakat), voluntary (waqf and sadaqah) philanthropic principles, as well as its encouragement to fostering the culture of science, technology, and advancement, in forming a steady pool of resources to enable financial inclusion. This research employs literature review, conceptual analysis and qualitative case study methodology to provide an overview of how fintech start-ups in Finland and Malaysia facilitate financial inclusion through the illustration of two major fintech sectors, namely e-marketplace/payments and crowdfunding/peer-to-peer (P2P) financing. We synthesize that open innovation further enhances fintech services to elevate social finance from its current infrastructure to a more sustainable outcome-base funding, changing the way capital could be mobilized for social impact. Our findings also suggest that Islamic fintech offers an effective and efficient alternative to raising funds in the backdrop of financing the underserved individuals, while providing a knowledge-based platform that enhances customer-service provider intimacy to guide future social finance decisions. © 2020 SERSC.",Article,2-s2.0-85084368157

One that is experiencing growth is financial transactions that are shifting towards application-based digital namely the application of Financial Technology applications. But from the success of the application, there are still problems that harm the user and indicate reducing the level of user confidence in the application. This study aims to analyze, test and explain the role of moderation of trust in the effects of system quality, information quality, service quality on application user satisfaction. The results show that information quality most determines user satisfaction. Meanwhile, the quality of service is not able to increase user satisfaction, but with the trust can strengthen the quality of application services in determining the satisfaction of application users, besides that the service is always available and on time when users experience problems that are needed by application users. This finding can enrich the success model of DeLone and McLean (2003) information systems that use system quality, information quality, and service quality variables to user satisfaction, in this study adding moderation variables, namely trust. © 2020, Hampstead Psychological Associates.

This process is known as the stock selection in portfolio construction. It is about this problem, the paper is designed to address with the help of machine learning task especially one of the supervised learning methods, Artificial Neural Networks. Once this task is accomplished, to find out an efficient portfolio, among a basket of financial portfolios, applied various approaches. One such approach is to compute the minimum variance portfolio subject to the target return. This is the basis of Mean variance theory put forward by Markowitz. Based on this approach the neural network is trained to attain an efficient portfolio.

In order to deal with the dishonest problems of different parties, we build a caching-chain network based on blockchain. This network is a pure peer-to-peer system, which allows file acquisition transactions without going through a centralized issuer or controller, but attains a reliable and tamper-proof value transfer. The utilization of smart contracts protects the interests of all parties in the untrusted caching market. By reasonably distributing the reward of generating new blocks, we can motivate the MNO to allocate more resources for offloading the traffic of the CP. In addition, we use the linear regression model to predict user mobility and design the cache placement policy accordingly. Furthermore, we compare the performance of three caching algorithms through simulation.

"Xie Z., Wu R., Hu M., Tian H.",Blockchain-Enabled Computing Resource Trading: A Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach,2020.0,Computing resource trading; continuous double auction; deep reinforcement learning.,"Driven by the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT) under the fifth-generation (5G) wireless network, computing resource trading attracts numerous attention from both academia and industry. Prior works mainly focus on the design of auction mechanisms to implement pricing and resource allocation. However, it is still a challenging problem because of the following three aspects: 1) How to ensure that the auction mechanism runs fairly An auction mechanism is vulnerable and questionable since the auctioneer may fail the orders matching operation or collude with a few peers. 2) It's hard to assign the computing resources of providers to customers and guarantee reasonable rewards for each participator. 3) How to make bidding strategies for each participator Each participator has its willingness to selWuy, which are time-variant and private. To address the above issues, we build a blockchain-enabled computing resource trading system that takes both pricing and bidding strategies into consideration, on which providers and customers can trade computing resources securely, safely and willingly. Next, we formulate a decision-making problem in the continuous double auction (CDA) to maximize their payoffs. Then, we propose a universal model-free Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) framework for both computing resource providers and customers. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of our DRL framework. Simulation results show that our solution outperforms others in both static and dynamic scenarios. Our DRL framework can achieve higher rewards than others by at least 35%. Furthermore, the average trading price from our DRL framework is less volatile than that from the compared methods. The DRL framework promotes trading and brings larger trading quantities, thus resulting in higher social welfare by at least 25% than the compared schemes. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85087281873

The results are robust to different empirical approaches. Results imply that it would be important for regulators to provide greater transparency in terms of guidance and regulatory clarity on which alternative data can be used legally without violating fair lending rules.

Reinforcement learning takes quick and specific local decisions, deep learning clusters enables identity and memory, and deep learning management clusters make final strategic decisions. The presented genetic algorithm transmits the learned information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. Because the subject’s information, a combination of memory, identity and decision data, is never lost but transmitted, the genetic algorithm provides immortality. The management decision structure has been applied and validated in a smart investment Fintech application: an intelligent banker that makes buy and sell asset decisions with an associated market and risk that entirely transmits itself to a future generation.

However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to attacks aimed at adversely impacting their node classification performance. Existing studies of adversarial attacks on GNN focus primarily on manipulating the connectivity between existing nodes, a task that requires greater effort on the part of the attacker in real-world applications. In contrast, it is much more expedient on the part of the attacker to inject adversarial nodes, e.g., fake profiles with forged links, into existing graphs so as to reduce the performance of the GNN in classifying existing nodes. Hence, we consider a novel form of node injection poisoning attacks on graph data. We model the key steps of a node injection attack, e.g., establishing links between the injected adversarial nodes and other nodes, choosing the label of an injected node, etc. by a Markov Decision Process. We propose a novel reinforcement learning method for Node Injection Poisoning Attacks (NIPA), to sequentially modify the labels and links of the injected nodes, without changing the connectivity between existing nodes. Specifically, we introduce a hierarchical Q-learning network to manipulate the labels of the adversarial nodes and their links with other nodes in the graph, and design an appropriate reward function to guide the reinforcement learning agent to reduce the node classification performance of GNN. The results of the experiments show that NIPA is consistently more effective than the baseline node injection attack methods for poisoning graph data on three benchmark datasets. © 2020 ACM.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85086577699

Our knowledge of how to develop and manage the digital platforms that make P2P lending possible, however, is limited. Through an in-depth examination of the strategies deployed and actions taken across the various stages of development of Tuodao, one of the most successful online P2P lending platforms in China, the purpose of this study is to develop a process model of P2P Lending Platform Development to address this knowledge gap. Design/methodology/approach: The case research method was adopted for this research, and a total of 16 informants were interviewed. The informants were composed of representatives of Tuodao’stop management, organizational IT functions as well as its various business units. Findings: Our study reveals that the development of a P2P lending platform can unfold in a specific sequence across three stages, and the development of a particular side of the platform should be emphasized in each stage (i.e. Partners, followed by Lenders, and then Borrowers). Each stage is also distinctive in terms of their strategies and platform configuration outcomes, which are elaborated on in our paper. Originality/value: Our process model contributes an in-depth view of how P2P lending platforms should be established and nurtured to complement the existing studies in this rapidly growing research area. In addition, our study also hints at the strategies that can facilitate the various stages. Our model can potentially serve as the foundation for formulating guidelines for the managers of P2P lending platforms, so that they are able to optimize the development of their platforms and extend the benefits of P2P lending to a broader base of customers. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85084221078

Design/methodology/approach: This exploratory study is qualitative in nature and utilizes semi-structured interviews at 14 African fintech firms. Findings: The study reveals that, during intra-Africa expansion, firms adapt their marketing strategies by working with local people, prioritizing customer education, creating personal relationships with customers, adapting their communication strategies and pricing strategies and using social media. The strategies that have been most effective involve including the community in the marketing process, prioritizing relationships, segmenting customers geographically, educating customers about products, using local distribution partners and having a flexible approach to strategy adaptation. Practical implications: It has been argued that technological innovation in Africa in areas such as financial services is a critical driver of its future development, because of the opportunity it presents to promote financial inclusion. Through an increase in venture capital investment on the continent, technological innovations in financial services have grown exponentially, and this study contributes to the understanding of the marketing strategies employed to gain market traction. Originality/value: This study proposes that African fintech firms adopt a bottom-up, value proposition-driven marketing strategy to successfully navigate the environment. The proposed framework provides a lens through which to understand the components of successful strategy adaptation in Africa, against the backdrop of the unique market challenges inherent in this emerging market continent. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85083856273
"Gruin J., Knaack P.",Not Just Another Shadow Bank: Chinese Authoritarian Capitalism and the ‘Developmental’ Promise of Digital Financial Innovation,2020.0,China; financial inclusion; financial regulation; fintech; institutional change; online lending; shadow banking,"China's financial system is rapidly evolving. Both the emergence of shadow banking since 2009 and the growth of fintech since 2013 as forms of ‘non-bank credit intermediation’ have catalysed market-oriented institutional change beyond the banking system, with potentially far-reaching economic and political implications. In this article we assess these developments in the broader trajectory of China's financial reform and economic development. Through an analysis of two key sectors of non-bank credit intermediation–wealth management products and online lending platforms–we find that the growth of both shadow banking and fintech can be located in the same trajectory of reform and development that has animated Chinese financial policy since the early 1990s. The toleration of WMPs and promotion of internet lending constitutes the latest stage of the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to construct a more efficient and sustainable market economy whilst simultaneously preserving political supremacy and custodianship of macro-social development. The difference in policy response is commensurate with the degree to which each financial sector meets the Party's twin objectives of economic development and political control. Counterintuitively from a Western liberal perspective, the very forces behind deep and broad financial liberalisation are also consolidating the Chinese Communist Party's overall legitimacy and ruling capacity. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

This study analyse government regulations on financial services authority regulation No. 77/POJK.01/2016 concerning Information Technology-Based Lending and Borrowing Services, even though it has been regulated about lending and borrowing services, the government does not seem ready enough to faceagainst regulatory issues related to criminal acts related to the protection of personal data. Basically, the problems that arise require the consequences of inter-agency or ministerial relations, for example in the ministry of communication and information (kemkominfo) with financial service authority institutions.

The concept of market and consumer has shifted dramatically to a new level as technology emerged in financial services industry. However, such service is not familiar among the marginalised people as it involves technology and cost. Scheduled tribes in India have been viewed as the most distraught social group subject to age-old financial and social hardships. Financial literacy on financial services has been shown to be a crucial factor in making effective decisions and choices regarding finance. This paper tries to examine both overall and category wise financial literacy of scheduled tribes in Kerala with special emphasis on gender. It uses primary data of 393 tribal respondents from seven tribal communities across the most three tribally populated districts. It observed that, there are disarrays in the use of fintech services among tribes. The tribal community has not been able to find satisfactory literacy in fintech services. But they have a healthy knowledge on other basic financial and banking services, and women often outperform men in this regard. © 2020 SERSC.",Article,2-s2.0-85084054122

"Reith R., Fischer M., Lis B.",Explaining the intention to use social trading platforms: an empirical investigation,2020.0,Digital platform; Financial innovation; Financial technology; FinTech; Social trading,"The enormous rise of financial technology companies has greatly challenged traditional financial institutions. One emerging innovation is “social trading” (ST), which combines the advantages of social networks and delegated trading. ST platforms represent a unique context of social media platforms, on which the impact of social influence on the potential customer’s intention to use is not well understood. Moreover, researchers and practitioners lack an understanding of the moderating role of the consumer’s previous experience regarding security trading. As research in the field of ST is rather young, our study aims to be the first to address these research gaps by developing and empirically validating a model from the potential customer’s perspective. We based our framework on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and theory regarding social media and financial decision-making. Our results illustrate that performance-related aspects are the dominant determinants of behavioral intention for experienced users, whereas system-related and personal barriers affect behavioral intentions of the inexperienced group. Consequently, differences regarding performance expectancy, effort expectancy, security and risk aversion were identified. Our results indicate that current platform operators’ advertising approaches of communicating the simple functionality of the platform seem inappropriate to meet the consumer’s needs. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85075370844

In finance, average options are popular financial products among corporations, institutional investors, and individual investors for risk management and investment because average options have the advantages of cheap prices and their payoffs are not very sensitive to the changes of the underlying asset prices at the maturity date, avoiding the manipulation of asset prices and option prices. The challenge is that pricing arithmetic average options requires traditional numerical methods with the drawbacks of expensive repetitive computations and non-realistic model assumptions.

Previous researches in developing economies have shown visible trends in the way the phenomena is influencing these decisions and is helping drive revenue growth and sustainable competitive advantage to those who have fully embraced it. As such, this research will help provide the relevance of the phenomena in a Zimbabwean context and whether it has an impact (if at all) in banking firms or fintech firms’ profitability. Today, there is more data available from different source than there ever was at any other point in history. The emergence of this data and its sources has enabled financial technology firms to drive product innovation resulting in profitability growth at a rate faster than traditional banks. This study therefore investigated whether the extent of data driven decision making currently employed by banks helps explain the low profitability and subsequent performance by Banks. A quantitative study was employed on Zimbabwean banking institutions. The main objective of this study was to ascertain whether the current investment in modernisation of Information Technology infrastructure (or lack of it), contributed to the low bank performance as measured by profitability. © 2020, Advanced Scientific Research.

There are many researchers trying to study and create the mathematical model to improve the pairs trading strategy on various assets such as cointegration method, OLS, Kalmann filter, Machine learning, etc. The purpose of the models is to generate the precise signals from pairs of assets to maximize the return based on statistical arbitrage of pairs trading strategy. In this paper, Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy is studied further. Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy is easy, straightforward and profitable. However, There are many factors which influence the profitability of the strategy, causing the loss trades. We purpose a novel approach by using the machine learning algorithm to learn the historical trades of Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy in foreign exchage rates and to predict the profitability in the future trades. The pairs of the exchange rate are filtered by choosing only the pairs which generate the positive average return per trade from Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy in the past. The capability of the ML models is to classify whether the signals from Stress Indicator pairs trading strategy is profitable or not before opening the positions. The powerful ML models, Artificial Neural network and XGBoost, are implemented in this study. Several factors which could influence the profitability such as correlation, volatility OLS beta are collected and used to train the model following the common step of ML training procedures such as features selection, Hyperparameter tuning and k-Fold cross validation to generate the capable models. Next, the performance of ANN and XGBoost is compared that which one performs better by the score matrix. The result shows that the performance of predicting the profitability is not significantly different. Both models mostly achieve 60% accuracy in In-sample data, but the accuracy in out-of-sample data is quite fluctuated. In other words, ML models are capable to classify the profitable signal from price behavior but may lack of consistency. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85086070407

The mining pool, which is considered the source of Bitcoin, is the cornerstone of market stability. The surveillance of the mining pool can help regulators effectively assess the overall health of Bitcoin and issues. However, the anonymity of mining-pool miners and the difficulty of analyzing large numbers of transactions limit in-depth analysis. It is also a challenge to achieve intuitive and comprehensive monitoring of multi-source heterogeneous data.

At the pool level, we use a sorted stream graph to illustrate the evolution of computing power of pools over time, and glyphs are designed in two other views to demonstrate the influence scope of the mining pool and the migration of pool members. At the address level, we use a force-directed graph and a massive sequence view to present the dynamic address network in the mining pool. Particularly, these two views, together with the Radviz view, support an iterative visual reasoning process for de-anonymization of pool members and provide interactions for cross-view analysis and identity marking.

Saiz A.,"Bricks, mortar, and proptech: The economics of IT in brokerage, space utilization and commercial real estate finance",2020.0,Coworking; Fintech; Future of real estate; IT; Online brokerage; Proptech,"Purpose: Digital and information technologies (IT) are becoming silently pervasive in old-fashioned real estate markets. This paper focuses on three important avenues for the diffusion of IT in commercial real estate: online brokerage and sales, the commoditization of space and Fintech in mortgage and equity funding. We describe the main new markets and products created by this IT revolution. The focus is on the pioneering US market, with some attention devoted to the specific firms and institutions taking these innovations into the mainstream. We also carefully analyze the economic underpinnings from which the new technologies can expect to generate cash flows, thus becoming viable—or not. Finally, we discuss their likely impact on established players in the commercial real estate arena. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the author chooses to focus on three separate arenas where the IT revolution—sometimes referred to as Proptech, as applied to real estate—is having discernible impacts: sales and brokerage, space commoditization and online finance platforms. The author invites the reader to think seriously about the economic fundamentals that may—or may not—sustain new business models in Proptech. Real estate economists and investors alike need to be critical of new business models, especially when they are being aggressively marketed by their promoters. Trying to avoid any hype, the author provides thoughts about the likely impact of the innovations on their markets, guided by economic and finance theory, and previous experience. Findings: The author evaluates the evolution of commercial real estate brokerage. While innovations will, no doubt, have an impact on the ways in which we buy and lease commercial properties, the lessons from the housing market should make us skeptical about the possibility of the new technologies dramatically facilitating disintermediation in this market. In fact, new oligopolies seem to be emerging with regard to market data provision. Practical implications: Proptech will change some aspects of the real estate industry, but not others! Originality/value: As change pervades the property industry, only a relatively few research pieces are illustrating or—more importantly—providing insights about the likely economic and financial impacts of IT penetration. Similarly, only a few papers have so far addressed the economic viability of the alternative business models of tech startups targeting real estate markets and transactions. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85082765257

Santosa P.W.,Determinants of price reversal in high-frequency trading: Empirical evidence from Indonesia,2020.0,High-frequency trading; Market microstructure; Price reversal,"This article analyzes whether the factors of the mechanism of high-frequency trading (HFT) or intraday trading affect the process of price reversal and continuation. The price reversal phenomenon is gaining importance rapidly due to the increasingly intensive use of IT/Fintech-based trading automation facilities on the Indonesia Stock Exchange. However, one knows little about how their trading affects volatility and liquidity pressures that cause price reversals. A new research approach uses the factors of market microstructure mechanism based on high-frequency data (HFD-intraday). The research method uses purposive random sampling, which classified price fractions into three groups, specifically low price, medium price, and high price, which are analyzed by logistic panel regression. The research variables used include price reversal (dependent), stock return, trading volume, transaction frequency, volume/ frequency (V/F) proxy, volatility, and liquidity. According to low price model research findings, all variables show a significant effect on price reversal; for medium price model, all variables except liquidity show a significant effect on price reversal; and for high price model, all variables have a significant effect on price reversal, except trading volume and volatility. In conclusion, low price shares tend to have higher price reversal probability compared to continuity because they tend to be liquid, low institutional ownership, and minimal reporting/analysis and are controlled by HFTs (uninformed traders). Some variables are not significant because of the bounce effect around the bid-ask spread. © Perdana Wahyu Santosa, 2020.",Article,2-s2.0-85082314491

In particular, a priority level can be assigned to each consumption goal and the model provides a holistic solution based on a sequential approach starting with the highest priority. This allows strict prioritization by maximizing the probability of achieving higher priority goals that are not affected by goals with lower priorities. Furthermore, the proposed model is formulated as a linear program that efficiently finds the optimal financial plan.

Rella L.,Steps towards an ecology of money infrastructures: materiality and cultures of Ripple,2020.0,cryptocurrencies; ecology; infrastructure; Money; payments,"Money’s materiality produces an ontological conundrum for social theory: should the analysis of money foreground the objects used as money, or the abstract relations that underpin it? Provoked by the emergence of cryptocurrencies, this paper develops a conceptualization of money as a technological and social infrastructure which directly addresses this theoretical impasse. Cryptocurrencies’ sole form of material existence coincides with their underpinning infrastructure of records, accounting and payments. In the past decade, cryptocurrencies have skyrocketed in number, and they have been applied to a host of use cases. This paper focuses on cross-border payments through the example of the fintech company Ripple, the cryptocurrency XRP, and the design of the XRP Ledger. Combining literatures from the social theory of money, science and technology studies and new materialisms, this article develops steps towards an ecological conceptualization of money infrastructures. Infrastructures, understood ecologically, include devices, active forms, and imaginaries in seamless webs of mutual relations of co-evolution. These ecologies are always potentially prone to slippage, dissolution, disassembling, reassembling and reappropriation, dependence, and competition. © 2020, © 2020 The Author(s).

It is potentially one of the game changing disruptive forces which have transformed the financial ecosystem leveraging the throughput of banking and financial services. The advent of financial technology has given much needed impetus to the otherwise struggling financial institutions, which have been able to cut down a lot on redundant costs. Resultantly, the institutions have been able to maximise operating efficiency and reduce costs to a large extent. The technology backed financial landscape has been improved over a period of time with results being evident in its profitability and other allied ratios. This research paper discusses a probable role which financial technology has played in the profitability of the financial institutions specifically banks in Indian context. © 2020 IJSTR.",Article,2-s2.0-85082848420

Guo L.,Regulating Investment Robo-Advisors in China: Problems and Prospects,2020.0,Fiduciary duty; Information disclosure; Power of attorney; Robo-advisor,"The robo-advisor excels at simplifying the process of making investments, improving its efficiency. Since its first appearance in the market, it has been welcomed by investors across the world. However, the current regulatory system in China is not only overly restrictive, but also unable to provide proper guidance to regulate securities investment advisors. The development of Chinese robo-advisor business faces various obstacles, such as high entry barriers, the inability to provide comprehensive wealth management services. These difficulties are due to prohibitions on granting securities advisors full power of attorney. The uncertain legal status of robo-advisors also creates issues with legitimacy. In addition, there is severe information asymmetry and a lack of investor protection in the operation of robo-advisors. These problems have impeded the development of the robo-advisor industry in China. In light of the approaches of the US and Australia in regulating robo-advisors, this paper suggests that China should consider an incremental approach that is tailored to domestic conditions to promote the growth of its robo-advisor industry. Recommended measures include: improving information disclosure requirements, refining the fiduciary duties of robo-advisors, and regulating the algorithms of robo-advisors. Regulatory sandbox may also be considered, as it could encourage the development of financial technology while mitigating the risks arising from the use of such technology. © 2020, T.M.C.

The full potential of FinTech to support the SDGs may be realized with a progressive approach to the development of underlying infrastructure to support digital financial transformation. Our research suggests that the best way to think about such a strategy is to focus on four primary pillars. The first pillar requires the building of digital identity, simplified account opening and e-KYC systems, supported by the second pillar of open interoperable electronic payments systems. The third pillar involves using the infrastructure of the first and second pillars to underpin electronic provision of government services and payments. The fourth pillar—design of digital financial markets and systems—supports broader access to finance and investment. Implementing the four pillars is a major journey for any economy, but one which has tremendous potential to transform not only finance but economies and societies, through FinTech, financial inclusion and sustainable balanced development. © 2020, T.M.C.

The paper seeks to explore and understand the drivers of P2P lending sectors in Indonesia and to determine the challenges faced by the peer-to-peer lending sector in Indonesia by analyzing the three perspectives of this sector: users (lenders & borrowers), businesses, and regulator. A qualitative approach is used to collect and analyze data. The data is collected through open-ended and in-depth interviews with users, companies and government agency. A thematic analysis method using code mapping was developed during data analysis. The finding shows different results, from the regulator’s perspective, business lending users’ and borrowers’ views. Business opportunity and platform convenience are the drivers, policy risks and lending system are the challenges. The paper concludes there is still a potential sector in an early stage of development. Many improvements can be done through regulations, businesses approach (i.e., policy), and user participation in supporting small businesses. The findings found that OJK might be one party that has planned far in the future of P2P lending, such as the planning of users’ data privacy regulations, and regulations for P2P lending businesses that will not be too strict and still supports its innovation and development. Thus, with such changes, there could be more drivers and challenges in the future that can be explored. ICIC International ©2020.",Article,2-s2.0-85078905382

Currently, grid operators use flexibility measures to counter this challenge. However, these measures struggle to cope with the growth in renewables. There are numerous proposals to improve flexibility measures using distributed energy resources such as electric vehicles (EVs). However, there is a need for a platform whereby EVs can be leveraged directly by grid operators. In answer to the decentralized quality of EVs and the requirements defined by our automotive industry partner, we propose a platform based on a distributed ledger technology (DLT). To achieve this goal, we first designed a concept for a decentralized flexibility market for the stakeholders of the ecosystem. The concept serves as the blueprint for the implementation of the platform. With the design and its implementation and simulation, we validated the use case and technical feasibility of the chosen DLT. We conclude that our prototype has the potential to allow grid operators to leverage idle EVs in aggregation to mitigate congestion. © 2020 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089155230

Despite great research efforts devoted to leveraging deep learning methods for building better quantitative strategies, existing studies still face serious challenges, such as how to establish effective high frequency predictor variables, how to solve in-sample overfitting in a high-dimensional setting and how to balance the risk and return. In this paper, we propose a hybrid deep learning based high frequency technical indicators investment strategy approach enhanced by elastic net model, which called SDNN, to address the above challenges. Our main contributions are summarized as follows: i) We establish several high frequency technical indicators and investigate the statistically and trading significant in-sample and out-of-sample predictive power for each indicators. ii) we suggest a elastic net model to shrinking the dimensional of predictive factors in order to improve the out-of-sample performance in high-dimensional setting. iii) we integrate deep learning method with a Sharpe-optimised framework to achieve a risk-return balanced investment strategy.

The stated goal of the XS2A rule is to help an infant industry grow: that of Fintech payment services. However, mounting evidence suggests that unlike Fintech startups, big techs may benefit from the norm, putting a much stronger challenge to established banks. The latter indeed have less access to data about consumers’ behavior (preferences, habits and conducts), less analytics capacity, and thus are placed in a competitive disadvantage by the XS2A, compared to their big tech rivals. According to many, that may result in competition harm and consumer welfare reduction in the medium and long run. The article revisits the rationales for introducing the XS2A rule by critically assessing its asserted goals (Part 1). It then suggests (Part 2) that to level the playing field among the market players involved and increase its overall proportionality, the norm be revisited. In the relationship between big tech and the banks, we propose to complement the XS2A rule with a “reciprocity clause”. Instead of free access to customers’ account data, big tech would pay by counter-providing access to the behavioral data in their possession pertaining to the same customers concerned by the XS2A, and upon their consent. Data thus transmitted would only be available upon condition of reuse to increase the efficiency of the payment service provision. Reciprocity would greatly enhance data circulation among market participants, while fostering competition among them, creating incentives for more innovation and strengthening the overall proportionality of the XS2A rule. © 2020, Max Planck Institute for Innovation and Competition, Munich.",Article,2-s2.0-85081570892
Pelckmans K.,Monitoring high-frequency data streams in FinTech: FADO Versus K-Means,2020.0,artificial intelligence; filtering; fintech; Fraud detection,"Modern applications of FinTech are challenged by enormous volumes of financial data. One way to handle these is to adopt a streaming setting where data are only available to the algorithms during a very short time. When a new data point (financial transaction) is generated, it needs to be processed directly, and be forgotten immediately after. Especially, ongoing globalization efforts in FinTech require modern methods of fault detection to be able to work efficiently through more than 10 000 financial transactions per second if they are to be deployed as a first line of defence. This article investigates two algorithms able to perform well in this demanding setting: K-means and FADO. Especially, this article provides supports for the claim that the use of multiple clusters does not necessarily translate into increased detection performance. To support this claim, results are reported when operating in a quasi-realistic case study of Anti Money Laundering (AML) detection in real-time payment systems. We focus on two prototypical algorithms: the passive aggressive FADO assuming a single cluster, and the well-known K-means algorithm working with K> clusters. We find-in this case-that the use of K-means with multiple clusters is unfavorable as 1) both tuning for K, as well as the need for additional complexity in the K-means algorithm challenges the computational constraints; 2) K-means introduces necessarily added variability (unreliability) in the results; 3) it requires dimensionality reduction, compromising interpretability of the detections; 4) the prevalence of singleton clusters adds unreliability to the outcome. This makes in the presented case FADO favorable over K-means (with K>1). © 2001-2011 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85081297153
Donald D.C.,Smart Precision Finance for Small Businesses Funding,2020.0,Corporate finance; Data analytics; Fintech; Small business finance; SME finance,"Small businesses are at the heart of most economies. Yet their combination of high risk and opacity with uncertain return dissuades banks and other investors from providing the necessary financial backing to get a business off the ground. Overcoming the significant asymmetries of information is simply not seen as worth the high transaction costs required. Technology—particularly digitalization and data analytics—has in recent years lowered the transaction costs of small business lending through automated systems capable of analyzing varied data sources indicative of the borrower’s solvency and stability. Ownership of this data by large service providers has, in this new market, tended to indicate a potential capture of small business borrowers by the lending firms with the largest networks. This paper sketches the parameters of an application for the ‘smart precision financing’ of small businesses, through an analysis of the legal and technological innovations that could be introduced to make such financing simpler while allowing the market to retain dynamism, thus increasing funding and funding options available to small businesses. The precision financing concept seeks to decrease information asymmetry and transaction costs while also limiting agency risk of a borrower misapplying funds.

We studied how mobile payment providers engaged in innovation of their business models, and thus identified three pertaining aspects: rethinking the relationship management with retailers, creating partnerships with other actors in the payment ecosystem to complement and deliver the proposed value, and integrating and using front-end mobile technology. Furthermore, our study suggests that mobile payment providers need to adapt their role within the ecosystem to scale the platform, and that it will depend on their choice of scope of geographic availability. Finally, we suggest that mutual adaptation of BMs of platform-associated actors leads to improved diffusion of the platform offer, which also hints at the need for researchers to revisit innovation diffusion and technology adoption theories by acknowledging the importance of the BM of the offer side of technology. © 2019 The Authors",Article,2-s2.0-85079142283

Robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like India, since early 2015. This research explores the present state of Robo-advisory services in the Indian context and investigates how Robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. The present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of Robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. These experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from BFSI (Banking and Financial Services Industry), IT (Information Technology), FINTECH (Finance Technology) and NBFCs (Non-Banking Finance Companies) in India. The researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about Robo-advisory services. Each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. The transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. The intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of Robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as Indian market is concerned. The key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that Robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors.

These include Big Data, Internet of Things and FinTechs such as blockchain. Blockchain is a type of a distributed database that is used to replicate, share, and synchronise data spread across different geographical locations such as multiple sites, countries, or organisations. The main property of blockchain is that there is no central administrator or centralised data storage mechanism. Consensus algorithms govern the peer-to-peer decentralised network. Numerous benefits and applications of blockchains have resulted in it becoming popular among a broad spectrum of businesses, but is it the case in the construction industry? Given, the backward nature of the construction industry in digitalisation and its reticence to change, it becomes important to analyse the potential impact of Blockchains as a potential disruptive technology. Although there exists a significant research gap and the potential possibility to test blockchain in the construction sector, the construction industry is historically reported as the second lowest sector to have adopted information technology. This leads to a conundrum whether blockchain is a pure technological hype or whether there is a real potential application in construction. The paper is aimed at critically analysing the application potential of blockchains in construction through a use case analysis and comprehensive literature review to resolve whether it is pure hype or real.

For this purpose, by adopting the social network analysis methodological approach, it considers the geographical network of Bitcoin transactions as a proxy to measure the national level of fintech development and compares it with a set of economic freedom indicators related to the top 70 world economies. The analysis revealed significant relationships between the performed network centrality measures and national levels of economic freedom. In particular, as confirmed by the implemented multilevel regression models, high levels of freedom to trade internationally combined with a restrained value of inflation and low administrative requirements can be considered as determining factors for fintech development. The study also showed a large number of Bitcoin transactions conducted in those countries characterized by fewer capital controls and restrictions, a result that feeds suspicions of illegal behavior, such as money laundering or terrorism financing, carried out through the use of cryptocurrencies.

Narayan S.W.,Does fintech matter for Indonesia’s economic growth?,2020.0,Economic growth; FinTech; Indonesia,"This paper investigates the role of financial technology (FinTech) in propelling economic growth in Indonesia from 1998 to 2018. The FinTech industry employs a technology-based business model to provide financial services, including lending, payment, investment, and financing services. The study is motivated by endogenous growth theory, which seeks to explain technology as the most important driver of economic growth. The study finds that FinTech startups are positively correlated with Indonesia’s economic growth. FinTech firms in their first year are found to be disruptive, but they fail to have serious consequences on Indonesia’s economic growth; however, they seem to significantly encourage economic growth in their second year. These findings are derived after accounting for other important growth determinants, namely, capital per labor, foreign direct investment (FDI), stock market development, and trade openness. © 2019 Bank Indonesia Institute.

"Lee J.-M., Kim H.-J.",Determinants of adoption and continuance intentions toward Internet-only banks,2020.0,Adoption intention; Benefit–risk; Continuance intention; Innovation diffusion; Internet-only banks; Network externality,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to investigate the determinants of consumers' intention to adopt or continue to use Internet-only banks based on the benefit–risk framework and network externality theory. It also examines the difference in the determinants between pre- and postadoption stages of innovation. Design/methodology/approach: The proposed research model was tested by using online survey data collected from a South Korean sample, which was divided into two subgroups of 321 nonadopters and 351 existing users. Findings: In both pre- and postadoption stages, the number of services provided and trust had a significant positive impact on consumers' behavioral intentions, while security risks had a negative impact. Critical mass in the preadoption stage and convenience and economic efficiency in the postadoption stage had positive effects on consumer's adoption intention and continuance intention, respectively. Practical implications: Internet-only banks must reduce the security risks for consumers and increase their trust. In addition, to facilitate the adoption of nonadopters, focus should be on securing a critical mass; on the other hand, to promote the continued use of existing users, the focus should be on enhancing benefits such as convenience and economic efficiency. Originality/value: The results of this study confirm the influence of network externalities on consumers' adoption and use of financial technology services and show differences in consumer decision-making according to the innovation diffusion process. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85079713048

They help people escape poverty by facilitating investments in their health, education, and businesses. And they make it easier to manage financial emergencies-such as a job loss or crop failure-that can push families into destitution. A growing body of research reveals many potential development benefits from financial inclusion-especially from the use of digital financial services, including mobile money services, payment cards, and other financial technology (or fintech) applications. Although the evidence is somewhat mixed, even studies that do not find positive results often point to possibilities for achieving better outcomes through careful attention to local needs.1 Many poor people around the world lack the financial services that can serve these functions, such as bank accounts and digital payments. Instead, they rely on cash-which can be unsafe and hard to manage. That's why the World Bank has made it a key priority to promote financial inclusion-access to and use of formal financial services. Measurement is key to understanding financial inclusion and identifying opportunities to expand it. In 2011 the World Bank launched the Global Findex database, theworld's most comprehensive database on how adults save, borrow, make payments, and manage risks. Compiled using nationally representative surveys in of more than 150,000 adults age 15 and above in over 140 economies, the 2017 Global Findex database includes updated indicators on access to, and use of, formal and informal financial services.

Mobile Money has grown significantly, especially post demonetization, enabled by 'smart devices' such as smartphones, smartwatches, smart cards, toll payment devices, and voice-enabled products deploying the Internet of Things (loT). The ease and simplicity of payments through IoT devices are set to change the shopping experience and consequently retail permanently. The government of India's Digital India program is further likely to transform the entire nation into a digitally enabled society as well as a knowledge economy. Mobile money is becoming an essential tool for financial inclusion to unite the unbanked communities of rural India. Internet was introduced in India in 1995, and the first wave of e-commerce began soon after that. Artificial Intelligence (AI) and smart solutions are noticeable in the growth of mobile payments in India in dual ways, firstly in reducing fraud in high-risk mobile payments and secondly in improved Peer to Peer (P2P) Payment Platforms. Mobile payments through AI solutions is just one illustration of technology that is broadly used today, and that has already started advancing the FinTech industry forward for the Fourth Industrial Revolution. This embarks on a sound period of digital inclusion leading to mobile and internet connectivity, with the overall growth of Information and Communication Technology (ICT) networks in India. A dynamic force for next-generation e-commerce is the fast-multiplication of mobile phones, handheld computers, mobile devices and PDAs.

As a developing country, China's banking industry plays an important role in the financial industry, and its size ranks first in the world. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the systemic risks of China's banks in the digital economy era. We first compare the traditional indicator approach and the market-based approach theoretically, and Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) model, a market-based approach, is considered to be an efficient way to discover systemic risk in different perspectives. Based on static and dynamic models, we evaluate the contributions of sixteen China's listed banks to the systemic risk. Furthermore, we model bank exposures, extend the models by considering extreme circumstance, and incorporate the effects of Fintech and non-bank financial institutions. The results show the levels of systemic risks and the corresponding systemic importance rankings vary in different time periods. We find that the contributions of some small banks to systemic risk are even higher than some big banks during the sample period. Moreover, the big banks face less risks than most of the small banks when the banking system is in distress.

The result of this study is consistent overall, Java and outside Java Island, as shows that the growth in P2P lending in Indonesia does not have a significant impact on the growth of bank loans for Non-MSME lending. However, it does have a negative impact on the growth of bank loans for MSME lending. This is in line with the entrant’s disruptive trajectory process by which the entrants enter the competition through an underserved market (niche markets) and not through the main target market of the incumbent (MSME).

"Battisti E., Creta F., Miglietta N.",Equity crowdfunding and regulation: implications for the real estate sector in Italy,2020.0,Crowdfunding; Equity crowdfunding; Real estate crowdfunding; Real estate sector; Regulation,"Purpose: This paper gathers initial evidence about the nature and features of the equity crowdfunding model in Italy, especially in terms of regulations. The purpose of this study is to examine how equity crowdfunding might support the real estate sector in Italy. Design/methodology/approach: To explore the recent initiatives in the development of FinTech in Italy, especially referring to equity crowdfunding’s instrument, a qualitative perspective is used. In particular, this paper relies on primary data from regulations and secondary data from the public domain, which are examined in relation to the current literature. Findings: The results of this study show that equity crowdfunding represents a funding method that is rapidly increasing in Italy, despite rather rigid regulation. Among the various sectors involved, the real estate sector could benefit from the crowdfunding models and, specifically, from the equity one. The development of new real estate equity crowdfunding portals that allow diversification of investment (by reducing the typical entry barriers for real estate investment) could guarantee greater investment transparency and simplicity. Practical implications: Real estate crowdfunding can be a simple way to invest in the real estate industry. Thanks to the use of technology, specifically internet-based platforms, this type of crowdfunding allows for small investors, as well as professional investors, to access an asset class otherwise not open to small investment tickets and improve the diversification of investments. Originality/value: Although recent literature has examined the concept of crowdfunding and highlighted different models, aspects and campaigns, no prior studies, to the authors’ knowledge, have explicitly and jointly investigated, also based on the state of art of regulation, the equity crowdfunding model and the real estate sector in Italy. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Review,2-s2.0-85079450687

These FinTech companies provide financial products and services using different technologies to cover various financial areas including financing for businesses. For instance, financing-based crowdfunding platforms are one of FinTech examples that has been growing rapidly in last couple of years, making the access to finance easier for SMEs. Globally, many countries have issued number of regulations and licences for FinTech activities including Shariahcompliant financing-based crowdfunding platforms. These types of platforms shall provide Islamic financing solutions for SMEs that are alternative to Islamic banks financing solutions. However, as a new financial solution, it is expected to face some challenges in term of SMEs’ adoption. Therefore, this research aims at building a strategic framework for FinTechs that provide Shariahcompliant financing-based crowdfunding platforms to ensure SMEs adoption to their platforms. The initial conceptual framework was built based on different sources of academic literature in addition to Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. However, the strategic framework was ascertained through a case study on an existing platform called Beehive as well as semi-structured interviews with five SMEs that are using or used Beehive’s platform. The results consistently indicated that factors like cost, brand image, speed, customer relations management, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and social influence were found to be affecting the SMEs’ behavioural intention to adopt Shariah complaint financing-based crowdfunding platforms. The valid factors collectively formed a strategic framework for FinTechs to follow in order to ensure the adoption by SMEs to their solution. © 2020 Mattingley Publishing.

Adopting systematic and historical methods of research, the dialectic of two typological structures of financial ties is considered. The interaction of distributed network structures with equal subjects of economic activity and hierarchical institutional structures with state participation is explored. It is revealed that with the development of innovations and financial technologies, the use of distributed network channels is increasing. The conclusion is made that there are potentially two strategic approaches for the development of banks: Evolutionary and revolutionary, involving in the first case the transformation of their classical business model into a technology company, and in the second, full absorption by alternative distributed services, based on block technologies and consumer power. © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

Similarly, the sharia financial technology industry also grows rapidly due to Muslim adoption of information technology for financial transaction. However, limited studies have been conducted to understand the factors that influence Muslim consumers to adopt sharia FinTech products. Through the use of the variables of halal product expectation, social environment, and fiqih knowledge, we surveyed eighty Muslim sharia FinTech consumers to understand whether those three variables affect their intention to use sharia FinTech products such as online loans. The results show that halal product expectation and fiqih knowledge factors have significantly affect Muslim consumers in Indonesia to use sharia FinTech products. Meanwhile, social environment, such as friends or higher Muslim figures, does not influence Muslim consumers to use the sharia FinTech products. We conclude that sharia FinTech companies should focus on improving their products to comply with Islamic sharia principles rather than using social environment to attract Muslim consumers to purchase their products. Future research may require more variable in similar studies to increase validity and reliability. © 2020, Primrose Hall Publishing Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85085189312
"Li Z., Wang R., Xu Y., Gao Y.",Financial technology efficiency and credit constraints facing the industrial sector: Evidence from China,2020.0,Credit constraint; Financial frontier technology; Stochastic frontier; System equations; Technology efficiency,"There is a close logical correlation between structural reform of the financial sector and the enhancement of financial institutions' economic performance. In the existing research, however, there are disagreements and gaps relating to the efficiency measurement of the financial system's input and output, as well as the impact of financial efficiency on the credit constraints facing the industrial sector. Based on China's provincial panel data from 2008 to 2016, this paper measures and decomposes financial technology efficiency, and selects system equations to comprehensively test the internal and external transmission mechanism of financial technology efficiency. The research finds that: (1) The key to improving the efficiency of input and output of China's financial system lies in the effective absorption and utilization of financial system reform and financial technology innovation, that is, the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology; (2) The key to improving the utilization efficiency of financial frontier technology lies in the overall reform of the economic system, including the development of the private economy, the expansion of market opening, the acceleration of service industry development, and the promotion of technological innovation. (3) The improvement of financial technology efficiency is the key to reducing costs, de-leveraging and increasing efficiency in the industrial sector. It can effectively alleviate the credit constraints facing the industrial sector and promote its high-quality development. Therefore, it is necessary to promote the reform and opening up of the economic system with a view to promoting the efficiency of the financial system, rather than simply resorting to financial system reform and financial technology innovation. © 2020 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85082813899

This is essential to establish a “Social Licence” for current and future practices. The notion of a “Social Licence” recognises that there can be meaningful differences between what is legally permissible and what is socially acceptable. Establishing a Social Licence entails public engagement to build relationships of trust and ensure that practices align with public values. While the concept of the Social Licence is well-established in other sectors – notably in relation to extractive industries – it has only very recently begun to be discussed in relation to digital innovation and data-intensive industries. This article therefore draws on existing literature relating to the Social Licence in extractive industries to explore the potential approaches needed to establish a Social Licence for emerging data-intensive industries. Additionally, it draws on well-established literature relating to trust (from psychology and organisational science) to examine the relevance of trust, and trustworthiness, for emerging practices in data-intensive industries. In doing so the article considers the extent to which pursuing a Social Licence might complement regulation and inform codes of practice to place ethical and social considerations at the heart of industry practice. We focus on one key industry: Financial Technology. We demonstrate the importance of combining technical and social approaches to address ethical challenges in data-intensive innovation (particularly relating to Artificial Intelligence) and to establish relationships of trust to underpin a Social Licence for Financial Technology. Such approaches are needed across all areas and industries of data-intensive innovation to complement regulation and inform the development of ethical codes of practice. This is important to underpin culture change and to move beyond rhetorical commitments to develop best practice putting ethics at the heart of innovation. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,2-s2.0-85081301849

This paper attempts to shed light on its contributing factors, current state, economic impacts and potential risks. We identify three key drivers for China’s fintech development, namely shortage of supply in formal financial market, strong government support for promoting financial inclusion through digital technology, and more ‘tolerant’ regulatory environment. The greatest value of the Chinese fintech sector is promotion of financial inclusion, enabling a vast number of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and low-income households to access to financial services. Existing studies unveil some strong evidences of fintech development improving efficiency, increasing employment and supporting entrepreneurship. In the meantime, there are also serious challenges facing this sector, such as regulatory uncertainties, illegal transactions, data abuse, etc. We conclude the paper by presenting some key takeaways, including several lessons for financial regulation. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85089904960

Among several significant steps, the country has made remarkable success in controlling the emissions from transportation, buildings, and energy by shutting down or relocating several polluting industries. This study contributes to the issue of sustainable growth debate using time series data from China for the period 1998–2017 and empirically examines the effects of green investment and renewable energy consumption on production-based carbon emissions for China. The strength of this study is that it tested some new variables such as production-based carbon emissions and green investment. Using autoregressive distributed lag model (ARDL) cointegration technique, we found that production-based emission and its determinants move together in the long run. The study found that green investment and renewable energy consumption are both helpful in controlling production-based carbon emissions, while trade openness increases production-based carbon emissions. Hence, green investment and renewable energy consumption contribute to the achievement of sustainable growth. Moreover, based on a robustness check, human capital, financial development, and environment-specific technological innovation are found to be helpful in curbing production-based carbon emissions. Our study recommends financial technology (fin-tech), green investment, and public-private partnership investment in renewable energy to mitigate the effect of production-based carbon emissions. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85087842446

The methodology used in this research are statute approach, conceptual approach, and comparison dispute settlement among Australia and Indonesia through law case study. According to the Indonesian Law as it is stated in BW (Civil Code for Indonesia), companies can settle their loan disputes by filing a lawsuit to the district court. This method is less effective because it is time consuming and costly, while it is not worth with the nominal value of the loan which is not that much. This situation leads to a demand of a faster, simpler and low-cost solution that can be accessed online. This method is called as small claim court method. This method is considerably new and basically is a simplified procedure of the existing dispute settlement. A strong note on this method is its weakness when the disputes happen cross-border. This aspect needs to be improved in many ways considering the current method is only applicable when the parties have the same judicial territory. Hopefully, the information technology strongly supports the task of the judiciary in order to enforce law and legal justice through the application of Electronic Court (e-court) which is in line with the principle of simple, fast and low cost of justice.

The heterogeneity analysis further indicates that the asset quality deterioration effect brought about by prosperous FinTech is more salient in banks with larger sizes, lower efficiency, more shadow banking business and more interest-based income. Moreover, the nexus between FinTech and banks’ risk taking is a U-shaped trend, with FinTech initially intensifying and then weakening banks’ risk taking. Moreover, the banks’ responses regarding the U-shaped effect are heterogeneous among different ownership structures.

E-wallets as the object of this research are Go Pay and OVO, the mostly used applications by society during Covid 19 pandemic and are the most popular e-wallet applications in Indonesia. This study applies Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by involving external variables that have never been particularly employed at once, such as Image, Perceived Enjoyment, Security and Trust, as the independent variables that might affect the internal variables in the TAM namely Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, and Attitude toward Use in influencing behaviors and intentions to use e-wallets. The sample of this study is Denpasar society with a sample of 154 respondents, the analysis technique utilizes the Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) method with SmartPLS 3.2 software. The results of this study indicates that TAM construct was commendable in explaining the acceptance process of e-wallet technology. However, those external factors are, in reality, critical in the acceptance of e-wallet technology. The security factor and user‟s trust are still lacking to support the acceptance of e-wallet technology. © 2020, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

Chinese P2P lending has expanded by a factor of 60 over the 4 years from 2013 to 2017. Consequently, it is now much greater, both in absolute terms and relative to the size of the economy, than in any other country. The industry though has been plagued by problematic often fraudulent business models in what was, until 2015, effectively a regulatory vacuum. A strict new regulatory regime is currently being introduced. However, the introduction of the strict new regulatory regime, especially the requirements on capital and registration are substantially reducing the volume of P2P lending. We consider the future of P2P lending concluding it is facing substantial uncertainties. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85089476029

Ransomware, a variant of malware, encrypts files, data, and often locks computer systems, and retains the decryption key until victims pay a ransom. Current method of ransomware mitigation is the analysis and classification of the ransomware and its variants to propose solution for detection and prevention. This mitigation approach omits technology users as part of the solution especially given their role in falling prey to ransomware by means of social engineering attack vectors. The purpose of this qualitative study was to highlight current and emerging ransomware vectors, and to identify cyber security awareness and education solutions that can be applied to mitigate socially engineered ransomware attacks. A semi-structured interview with executives and managers from several financial, technology, construction, transportation, education, and health industries revealed the lack of current awareness and training approaches to mitigate against socially engineered ransomware attacks. This study recommends some specific cybersecurity training and awareness approaches to consider in order to enable technology users resist and mitigate against ransomware attacks. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089629045

We use four waves of the biennial China Family Panel Studies from 2010 to 2016, during which time DFI has significantly developed alongside financial technology across China. We split household income shocks into permanent and transitory components, and evaluate if DFI may help households to buffer against these shocks. We find that households are not able to insure against permanent shocks to income, but they can smooth approximately 70 percent of transitory shocks to income. We also find that DFI has diminished households’ ability to insure against transitory income shocks. This is partly because online purchase may lead to the oversensitivity of consumption to income. In addition, we find that contrary to DFI, traditional financial sector development contributes to better household consumption smoothing against transitory income shocks. © 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",Article,2-s2.0-85079728049

Schiltz M.,Currency blocs: The yen,2020.0,Blocism; Gold-exchange standard; Imperialism; Japan,"Historically, unilateral political attempts at boosting the liquidity and prestige of a currency have rarely been successful. In the context of catastrophic events as, for instance, a World War, several countries have nevertheless experimented with schemes to develop currency blocs. This chapter describes the Japanese experiment with establishing an economic zone in which the yen was either the main or the sole currency of reference. We proceed chronologically. Taiwan and Korea are explained as consolidating currency policy in the nascent Japanese empire. World War I temporarily reversed Japan’s balance of payments problem. It heralded bold attempts at incorporating China within the Japanese yen-bloc, by means of aggressive lending schemes. Although the latter failed, the yen-bloc became an important political objective throughout the 1930s.

Equity crowdfunding provides another channel for startups to access capital and allows for a new mechanism for start-up firms to establish their reputation with investors. However, the risks to investors from equity crowdfunding are high. The high-risk nature of equity crowdfunding has the potential to act as a contagion, and further erode confidence in the startup capital market by retail investors--and this lingers over the GISA platform in Taiwan. Therefore, this study applies the of Random Forest (RF) algorithm to evaluate the market reaction for start-up firms on the GISA in Taiwan. The RF algorithm is proposed to be integrated into an AI model to forecast the market reaction to start-up firms as they get listed on the GISA equity crowdfunding platform. The results not only fulfill the gap of detecting market reaction in equity crowdfunding, but the proposed RF model can replace the traditional statistics analytical technique to evaluate the market reaction. In proposed model applied AI algorithms to predict the market reaction on Taiwan GISA platform which can provide a useful ensemble tool for start-up firms and entrepreneurs to evaluate the degree of market reaction more efficiently before listing on the Taiwan GISA platform. © 2020, World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

Crowdfunding is one of such non-traditional digital financing tools, representing new ML and FT risks. The main tool to counter legalization is a risk-based approach. Despite the fact that the FATF has developed a generally accepted methodology for assessing the risks of ML and FT, it is not a dogma and requires adaptation to new tools. Crowdfunding is one of the most promising digital financial instruments, but at the same time it is one of the most risky and insufficiently studied instruments in terms of ML and FT. Therefore, the article has explored and identified the features of crowdfunding as a new digital financing instrument for assessing its risks and threats in order to counter ML and TF (using the example of the Russian Federation and France).

In view of smart contracts’ legal effects, a study is implemented in this paper. First, Smart contracts appear as a set of computer codes, and carry the mutual consensus of the transaction parties and under the principle of freedom of contract form. Thus, smart contracts can be understood as a type of contractual written form in the high-tech context. Then the agreement automatic enforcement was made by the five-element structure, and the traditional situation of enforcement uncertainty was avoided. The results show that it is necessary to examine whether the meaning of the machine matches the meaning of the party, and whether the machine meaning is in conformity with the legal provisions. Finally, the conclusion was drawn that the legal effect of smart contract can be clarified in response to the booming financial technology. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85090039863

Though fintech innovations are touted as game changers in deepening financial inclusion, their wide acceptance and use still remain limited. In the extant literature, technological and behavioural antecedents that influence users’ behaviour toward financial technologies are not fully understood. This study argues that understanding antecedents to the actual use of fintech innovations will lead to deepening financial inclusion. Using mobile money—a type of fintech innovation, this study adopts the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) and the Prospect theory. Drawing on survey data collected from 294 respondents, this study applies the partial least square structural equation modelling technique. The findings show that performance and effort expectancy have significant relationship with the intention to use mobile money services. However, contrary to well-established positions, price value, hedonic motivation, social influence and perceived risk do not influence intention and use of mobile money services.

Specifically, we investigate the role of legal, criminal, financial, and social determinants of the adoption of Bitcoin infrastructure. We offer some support for the view that the adoption of cryptocurrency infrastructure is driven by perceived failings of traditional financial systems, in that the spread of Bitcoin infrastructure is associated with low trust in banks and the financial system among inhabitants of a region, and with the occurrence of country-level inflation crises. On the other hand, our findings also suggest that active support for Bitcoin is higher in locations with well-developed banking services. Finally, we find support for the view that bitcoin adoption is also partly driven by cryptocurrencies’ usefulness in engaging in illicit trade. © 2020, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85081572476

In the context of mergers and acquisitions (M&A), our research reveals that investors also gain insights from the “wisdom of crowds” on social media. We investigate whether investors' surprise emotion, as mined from their social postings on Twitter, exerts a significant effect on their subsequent decision-making following M&A announcements. Empirical results demonstrate that investors' surprise emotion has a significantly negative effect on firms' post-M&A stock returns. Such a finding facilitates investors' subsequent investment decision-making based on peers' early emotional responses on social media. Furthermore, we find evidence that investors also rely on additional information to estimate the reliability of such “wisdom of crowds” through two positive moderators such as investors' social media involvement and the relative size of M&A deal. The proposed methodology helps managers evaluate the synergetic potentials of M&A deals beforehand. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

Moreover, it discusses the impact of those actor-level responses on the resilience of entrepreneurial ecosystems (EEs), focusing on how they affect the diversity of and the connectivity among its actors. To address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has influenced the financial technology (FinTech) industry in London, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in London’s FinTech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies. Our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an EE. Moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms’ characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks. With regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms’ egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,2-s2.0-85086043027

Within the financial technology domain, an ideal approach should be able to operate proactively, without the need of knowing the behavior of non-reliable users. Actually, this does not happen because the most used techniques need to train their models with both reliable and non-reliable data in order to classify new samples. Such a scenario might be affected by the cold-start problem in datasets, where there is a scarcity or total absence of non-reliable examples, which is further worsened by the potential unbalanced distribution of the data that reduces the classification performances. In this paper, we overcome the aforementioned issues by proposing a proactive approach, composed of a combined entropy-based method that is trained considering only reliable cases and the sample under investigation. Experiments done in different real-world datasets show competitive performances with several state-of-art approaches that use the entire dataset of reliable and unreliable cases. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85073530311

It covers a large range of technologies, including big data, cloud computing, and cryptocurrency, and is widely used in the finance industry. Despite the broad application of FinTech, little academic research has explored the development of this new wave of technological innovations. Our study aims to identify, classify, and track the development of FinTech innovations using patent data. A difficulty is that there are no accurate International Patent Classification (IPC) codes that we can refer to as FinTech innovations. Hence, in this paper we provide a comprehensive method for identifying FinTech patents. We first use a text-based filtering technique to locate potential FinTech patents and get a data set comprising 37,156 records. We then construct a training sample of FinTech patents by reading those patent files manually. Next, textual analysis and machine-learning techniques are applied to identify all FinTech patents in the whole data set, based on the initial sample.

"Fenwick M., Van Uytsel S., Ying B.",Regulating fintech in asia: An introduction,2020.0,Banking law; Crypto-assets; Fintech; Payments; Regulatory sandbox,"In the context of a fast-developing, technology-driven economy, policymakers increasingly regard regulation as an essential element in gaining a competitive edge and establishing themselves as a regional hub for technology-focused businesses. In the context, of fintech, for example, a number of Asian jurisdictions have recently introduced regulatory reforms that aim at filling gaps in existing legislation or resolving uncertainties. Such legal reforms are motivated by the desire to encourage the development of fintech, while also ensuring that vital public interests are adequately protected. This book is a preliminary attempt to map some of these legal developments in an Asian context via a series of case studies focused on key jurisdictions. Here, by way of introduction to the substantive chapters that follow, we briefly review the disruption of incumbents and the new opportunities that have been triggered by the emergence of fintech and summarize the chapters and regulatory reforms that different jurisdictions have introduced. Common themes across all chapters are a recognition of the importance of fintech in the future development of financial services and the importance of more flexible regulatory forms that provide the freedom for all stakeholders to bring new financial technologies to the market. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85090254959

Therefore, we conducted an in-depth interview with 15scholars and Fintech specialists from different Gulf universities (i.e. from Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, and Oman). In addition, the study used secondary data to explore the current opportunities and education of universities in the field of Fintech; and the projects and researches in this field, which emerged with new technological developments in universities. Websites on the financial departments of universities in the GCC, data from the national education Ministry of the concerned countries were also examined.The findings reveal thatnone of the universities in the GCC is included in the top 10 leaders in Fintech/crypto education. Despite there are a sufficientnumber of finance departments and centers of research, most universities in the GCC have inappropriate education systems for preparing professional staff working in the Fintech sector. Furthermore, the training process is also not making the necessary progress for this industry to join the international race in this field. Approaches of education are still traditional and behind the advancement of others, there is classic methods of learning and education techniques with no real connection with technology. We conclude that each educated individual in the GCC has to think about Fintech in light of the fact that it may be one of the world's most significant advancements in the near future. Further, the blockchain technology may assist us with changing the connections among schools, colleges, universities and, thusly, their relationship to society. © 2019 SERSC.",Article,2-s2.0-85083176304
"Sunitha G., Madhav V.V.",A study on role of fin- tech in banking services: Opportunities and challenges,2020.0,Banking services; Challenges; Fin- tech; Opportunities; Role,"Fin- tech is one of the fastest-growing areas for banking services. It is simply termed as financial technology in which computer programs and other technology is used to support banking as well as financial services. According to many studies Fin- tech Adoption Index, one-third of consumers utilizes at least two or more fin- tech services and those consumers are also increasingly aware of fin- tech as a part of their daily lives. Entry of Fin- Tech firms in the banking industry has compelled banks to look for new offerings by creating the best environment for innovation with the help of Fin- Techs, considering them as a partner rather than a competitor. Initially, the term was applied to technology which is applied to the back-end of established consumer and trade financial institutions. At the end of the first decade of the 21st century, the term has extended to incorporate any technological innovation in the financial sector, with innovations in financial literacy and education, retail banking, investment and even crypto-currencies. The objective of the study is to analyze the role played by fin- tech in banking services and the opportunities which are serving banking services and the challenges faced by banking sector. Descriptive type of research is used for the study. Secondary as well as primary data has been gathered for the study. The sources for the data are through the websites of the fin- tech companies and banks. The study briefly explains the role played by fin- tech in banks overall development. This helps banks to overcome the situations and sustain to the changes in the market. The study describes the opportunities for banking sector and clearly explains the problems faced by banking sector.

Deipenbrock G.,FinTech - Unbearably lithe or reasonably agile? - A critical legal approach from the german perspective,2020.0,Artificial intelligence; Fintech; Insurtech; Invest-tech; Machine learning; Proptech; Regtech,"The revolutionary disruptive digital transformation in financial markets-a scenario more challenging than the 2007/2008 financial crisis-requires swift, agile but sustainable responses by the law. Mapping and analysing the plethora of legal implications of rapidly further evolving financial technology have gained momentum. The paper aims to contribute to it. Focus is on the German view. The following questions have inspired the analysis: How might FinTech best be defined and its most important manifestations best be systematized for legal purposes? Have the most pressing legal issues been addressed, so far? The paper considers the legal challenges of FinTech as huge, reaching far beyond financial markets. It argues that artificial intelligence and machine learning deserve utmost attention particularly in this context. The paper postulates that the law-being well-equipped to control the complex, constantly morphing risks of financial innovation while allowing exploiting its benefits-shall not just react to but lead the transformation. The present author considers particularly legal academia responsible for continuously steering and shaping a balanced and objective discourse leading to adequate legal responses in the realm of FinTech. It is time to reassert the crucial role of law in times of deep technological change not only in financial markets. 'It is a world of change-unparalleled, unsettling, dizzying change.

West Java is known as the most populous province in Indonesia, while Bali is the best province in rural bank performance through the assessment of Infobank Magazine in Indonesia, during the 2012–2016 Period. The study involves 212 banks in West Java and 134 banks in Bali over the period. Data envelopment analysis and Tobit regressions are employed to estimate the banks' technical efficiency and its determinants. The results show that the average efficiency of rural banks in Bali was higher than in West Java during the period. Inferential findings emphasize the importance of efficient resource use, sound loan-management, and adequate capital maintenance in bank operations. All these are required for rural banks to compete with other institutions including commercial banks and financial technology-based institutions in providing loans to micro and small businesses. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85081561309
Liao F.,Does china need the regulatory sandbox? A preliminary analysis of its desirability as an appropriate mechanism for regulating fintech in China,2020.0,Adaptive regulation; Disruptive innovation; Financial technology (fintech); Regulatory sandbox; Regulatory technology (regtech),"A regulatory sandbox is a safe space in which businesses can test innovative products, services, business models and delivery mechanisms without immediately incurring all the normal regulatory consequences of engaging in the activity in question. The fundamental purpose of the regulatory sandbox is to facilitate the development of fintech, especially the ‘disruptive innovation’ activities of the start-up enterprises. In this sense, the regulatory sandbox is a sub-category of the regulation of fintech. Fintech is technology-enabled financial innovation, synonymous with the term ‘internet finance’ in the Chinese context. A different but related term, the regulatory technology (regtech), in a broad sense refers to a combination of the ‘compliance technology’ by the market players with the ‘regulatory technology’ by the regulators. In nature, the regulatory sandbox is conditional, limited, and controlled deregulation. It was primarily a reaction to the somehow overly burdensome regulatory requirements after the Global Financial Crisis (GFC), thus leaving a ‘lifeline’ for financial innovation and, in particular, fintech. The situation is very different in China, where the major problem for internet finance it not over-regulation but under-regulation. With a vast territory, diversified areas, and numerous institutions, China does not feature a much developed and high concentrated financial market like that of the UK, Singapore, or the HK SAR. Nor does it have an integrated financial regulatory system. And, most importantly, the existing mechanisms in China are capable of performing equivalent or even more functions than the sandbox, which, if copied in China, would be redundant. In short, the regulatory sandbox is admittedly a remarkable innovation in terms of regulatory ideas and approaches conducive to financial innovation, especially fintech. However, with its specific background, exterior conditions, and intrinsic limitations, it is by no means an inevitable choice or universal model for the regulation of fintech. Based on the actual circumstances, it’s not desirable for China to introduce the sandbox, at least for the time being. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85090257795

Indeed, the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development (UN-2030-ASD) and the G20 High-Level Principles for Digital Financial Inclusion (G20-HLP-DFI) highlight the importance of harnessing the potential of FinTech to reduce financial exclusion and income inequality. This paper investigates the interrelationship between FinTech, financial inclusion and income inequality for a panel of 140 countries using the Global Findex waves of survey data for 2011, 2014 and 2017. We posit that FinTech affects inequality directly and indirectly through financial inclusion. We invoke quantile regression analysis to investigate whether such effects differ across countries with different levels of income inequality. We uncover new evidence that financial inclusion is a key channel through which FinTech reduces income inequality. We also find that while financial inclusion significantly reduces inequality at all quantiles of the inequality distribution, these effects are primarily associated with higher-income countries. Overall, our results support the aspirations of the UN-2030-ASD and G20-HLP-DFI.

"Sannino G., Di Carlo F., Lucchese M.",CEO characteristics and sustainability business model in financial technologies firms: Primary evidence from the utilization of innovative platforms,2020.0,CEO; Cultural drift; Fintech; Platforms; Smart technologies; Sustainability; Sustainable business model,"Purpose: This paper aims to investigate and discover the demographic characteristics of corporate leaders (CEOs) in Fintech sector firms representing the implementation of the sustainable business model. Particularly, the purpose is to identify a benchmark profile of CEOs and to understand which are the main features (e.g. age, tenure, education specification, education level, gender, nationality, years of entrepreneurship, years in financial functions, years in IT functions), giving more opportunity to develop and maintain sustainable business models using innovative platforms. Design/methodology/approach: The research questions are answered through a quali-quantitative methodology using descriptive and statistical approaches. The researchers collected a sample of 100 Fintech firms from the main Fintech firms in 2018 identified by the annual KPMG Report (2019). Thus, the research observed and tested the average level of the major CEO demographic features. Additionally, the paper explored whether these variables have a major probability to affect Fintech leading. Findings: Assuming a relevant part of Fintech firms, the main results of this paper show the relevance of several CEO demographic characteristics. Additionally, the age, the tenure and the presence of an MBA are significant elements in affecting Leading companies. Originality/value: The paper is novel because it contributes to the literature examining the internal governance and sustainable business model, still not explored. Moreover, this study contributes to identifying the CEO demographic characteristics that foster financial institutions' transition towards sustainable business models. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85082202135
Hudaefi F.A.,How does Islamic fintech promote the SDGs? Qualitative evidence from Indonesia,2020.0,Indonesia; Islamic fintech; Review; Sustainable development goals (SDGs),"Purpose: This study aims to explore the existing Islamic financial technology (fintech) lending in Indonesia. Doing so is to better understand in what way the fintech firms have been promoting the global movement of sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the local context. Design/methodology/approach: This study engages qualitative methods. This paper first reviews relevant literature related to fintech and establishes the substantive definition of Islamic fintech. Further, the existing literature of SDGs is explored to understand its original idea and its recent implementation, particularly in Indonesia. Following this, the official reports from the domestic regulators are referred to select the fintech firms which meet the criteria of Islamic fintech lending based on the proposed definition. The selected firms are then analysed based on several themes which best capture their position in promoting the SDGs. Finally, the discussion is linked to the recent performance of Indonesia in implementing SDGs. Findings: This work finds that the reviewed fintech firms have been promoting the idea of financial inclusion, for example, financing the underdeveloped sectors such as agriculture and small and micro enterprises (SMEs). Furthermore, the selected fintech firms are also found to collect and distribute Islamic social funds such as infaq (charity spending), waqf (endowment) and sadaqah (voluntary charity). Besides, the firms are also found to initiate charity programmes for underprivileged community. In some degree, these findings are synonymous of the firms’ effort in promoting SDG of ending poverty (SDG 1) and hunger (SDG 2) and reducing the inequalities (SDG 10). Research limitations/implications: The discussion of this work does not provide any positivist generalisation due to the method used. Practical implications: The Indonesian Government is advised to legally engage with the existing fintech firms and other related stakeholders to best solve its recent issue of the declining trend in SDG 15 (life on land). Social implications: This work elaborates in what way the Islamic fintech lending has been promoting the SDGs in Indonesian context. In some extent, such discussion can best challenge the social issue of fintech which has been stigmatised of bringing mafsadah (harm), as subjectively claimed by one particular religious group in Indonesia. Originality/value: This study is among the pioneers which offers the definition of Islamic fintech and further explains its position in endorsing the global movement of SDGs. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85081751758
"Yakushkin T.A., Romadikova V.M., Gorbatkova G.A., Havrel V.T., Mamengaev Y.N.",Financial Technologies Ensuring Information Transition,2020.0,Budget allocations; Digital economy; Digital financial instruments; Information society,"Goal: The goal of this chapter is to substantiate the need for the transformation of the financial system for the digital transition of society. The implemented state policy of informatization of all spheres of public life dictates the need not only for resource support of informatization events, but also requires restructuring of traditional financial mechanisms of maintenance of these processes. Today’s changes are impossible without a clear and efficient financing vehicle, fully adapted to the needs of digital economy and taking account of all possible complexities of remote account management. New financial instruments should be not only efficient, but also well protected from unauthorized use aimed at stealing funds from customer and state accounts. Methodology: in the process of the research, the principles of systematization and logical analysis of the text, the methods of graphic and tabular data analysis, horizontal and vertical analysis, the methods of generalizing and generating ideas have been used for the processing and assessment of statistical material. Results: In accordance with special features of a new model of ecosystem of the digital transformation of society, we need to search for new solutions both in the area of financing and in the area of finance services of occurring changes. Existing financial mechanisms do not have enough potential and capabilities for the prompt response to the needs of the financial market. All of the above gives rise to the emergence of new forms of provision of services to the customers—digital, online banks, the number and scale of which are constantly growing. Recommendations: The primary areas of digitalization of the financial sector that were discussed in this paper will promote accelerated transition of society to the communication platform. The development of existing and the introduction of new information tools for the provision of financial services online allows expanding capabilities of the financial sector for the provision of services for business in a digital environment. However, in order to achieve efficient use of new financial instruments, one should primarily create a new financial infrastructure that would allow keeping digital platforms operational and maintaining digital interaction. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85085289112

In this study, special emphasis is devoted to the application of a risk-engine, which is based on the contemporary concept of liquidity-adjusted value-at-risk (LVaR), to multivariate optimization of investment portfolios. Design/methodology/approach: This paper examines the modeling parameters of LVaR technique under event market settings and discusses how to integrate asset liquidity risk into LVaR models. Finally, the authors discuss scenario optimization algorithms for the assessment of structured investment portfolios and present a detailed operational methodology for computer programming purposes and prospective research design with the backing of a graphical flowchart. Findings: To that end, the portfolio/risk manager can specify different closeout horizons and dependence measures and calculate the necessary LVaR and resulting investable portfolios. In addition, portfolio managers can compare the return/risk ratio and asset allocation of obtained investable portfolios with different liquidation horizons in relation to the conventional Markowitz´s mean-variance approach. Practical implications: The examined optimization algorithms and modeling techniques have important practical applications for portfolio management and risk assessment, and can have many uses within machine learning and artificial intelligence, expert systems and smart financial applications, financial technology (FinTech), and within big data environments. In addition, it provide key real-world implications for portfolio/risk managers, treasury directors, risk management executives, policymakers and financial regulators to comply with the requirements of Basel III best practices on liquidly risk. Originality/value: The proposed optimization algorithms can aid in advancing portfolios selection and management in financial markets by assessing investable portfolios subject to meaningful operational and financial constraints. Furthermore, the robust risk-algorithms and portfolio optimization techniques can aid in solving some real-world dilemmas under stressed and adverse market conditions, such as the effect of liquidity when it dries up in financial and commodity markets, the impact of correlations factors when there is a switching in their signs and the integration of the influence of the nonlinear and non-normal distribution of assets’ returns in portfolio optimization and management. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Review,2-s2.0-85087552053

The factors which define the scope of world agricultural production are identified. It has been stated that at present a wide use of digital technologies is a key trend of the world economy of the last decade. World leaders in digital technology application are IT-companies, media, finance and insurance. The level of digitalization is much lower in true production and logistics. Agriculture is the last in the list. Basic components of digital infrastructure in the country were analyzed: telecommunication, geo-informational and mobile telecommunication. A successful experience in the introduction of updated financial technologies, oriented mostly on small agribusiness, farmers, was studied. It has been established that a branch standard in agriculture has to be the use of the system of geo-positioning, complex management of a machinery fleet, precise agriculture. A comparative analysis of the technology efficiency was made: aeroponics, hydroponics, traditional agriculture. The world market forecast of agricultural drone sales was presented. Major principles of the policy of “Ukraine’s digitalization” were identified. Five key components which constitute “digital” economy and, in turn, are in the center of “Digital agenda of Ukraine-2020” are suggested. The example of the support of the development of digital technologies and the initiatives of the EU concerning the development of digital economy was presented. The problems of the adaptation of Ukraine’s logistic projects to the world digital infrastructure were studied. Purpose of the article are: to determine the key factors that determine the transition of domestic agricultural production to digital agriculture; to form the tendencies of integration of local actors of the agro-industrial complex to the international digital infrastructure, to define measures for minimizing risks in digital logistics. Methods: In accordance with the objectives set in the article were used the following methods of research: dialectical method; system-structured on the principle of system research economic phenomena and processes; quantitative and qualitative comparison, analogies, observation, statistical and graphic methods; analysis, synthesis, system approach and abstraction; hypotheses and assumption, formalization. Findings & Value added: to develop information society in Ukraine, further regulation of legislature, improvement of the national policy aimed at overcoming some obstacles on the way to the integration of domestic entities of the agro-industrial complex to the world digital infrastructure, improvement of the acting system of risk management were suggested. © 2020 IJSTR.",Article,2-s2.0-85078837531
"Fenwick M., Vermeulen E.P.M.","Fintech, overcoming friction and new models of financial regulation",2020.0,Financial regulation; Fintech; Friction; Legal design; Regulatory experimentation,"The development of new technologies by financial service providers is not new; banks, for instance, have always utilized technology to improve front- and back-office operations. The historical significance of fintech does not derive from the use of technology per se, but the leveraging of the distinct properties of digital technologies by non-traditional actors to offer consumers a better experience of financial services. More specifically, the goal of overcoming ‘friction’ in the user experience is here identified as the core feature driving many recent developments in a fintech context. This chapter explores the implications of such an account for incumbent financial institutions and regulators. From the perspective of incumbents, this new emphasis on the consumer experience requires banks and other financial institutions to organize-for-innovation. New capacities and a shift in mindset are needed to deliver a different kind of user experience, and two effective strategies for incumbents are explored. First, adopting more decentralized forms of organization and governance—what we refer to as ‘decentralized ecosystems’—that are better placed to innovate and overcome friction. Second, adopting a more strategic approach to venturing, i.e., purchasing start-ups from the fintech sector and integrating their innovations into incumbent operations. From a regulatory perspective, this requires a greater willingness on the part of regulators and other policymakers to foster experimentation in financial services. As such, the goal of regulation needs to shift from a traditional focus on managing systemic risk to more dynamic models that seek to facilitate responsible innovation and the delivery of a better-quality user experience. This can be achieved, for example, by state regulators working together—partnering—with incumbents and start-ups in the financial service ecosystems of the future via regulatory sandboxes and other similar schemes. Regulatory developments in Asia and Europe provide some evidence that policymakers recognize the need for such a shift in emphasis. However, doubts remain about whether they have gone far enough in pursuing this goal and that the full benefits of the fintech revolution have been realized. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85090258908
Van Uytsel S.,Horizontal shareholding among fintech firms in Asia: A preliminary competition law assessment,2020.0,Asia; Competition law; Fintech; Go-Jek; Grab; Horizontal shareholding; Market division; Price increase,"This chapter introduces the problem of horizontal shareholding in the fintech sector in Asia. A great deal of the fintech debate surrounds Grab and Go-Jek, two ridesharing platforms that are aggressively expanding their business geographically and product-wise. To finance the expansion, these firms rely on various investors. These investors do often not limit their interest in these two firms but also become shareholders in firms offering the same products. This form of shareholding, also known as horizontal shareholding, is increasingly characterizing the fintech scene in Asia. This triggers the question on how this phenomenon should be approached from a competition law perspective. Horizontal shareholding indeed facilitates the flow of information between competitors or enables control over the executives of competing firms. The issue is still controversial as there is disagreement on the effects of horizontal shareholding and on how competition law should be applied to the issue. However, there is an understanding that further research is warranted. Part of this research, this chapter argues, should not be on direct price increase due to horizontal shareholding. The international character of the horizontal shareholding in the Asian fintech sector requires a rethinking of the possible anticompetitive effects. This chapter claims that such an effect may be market division. Enforcement may be a difficult issue. However, when a merger occurs in this sector, enforcement authorities should pay close attention to the issue of horizontal shareholding. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85090256727
Tokutsu A.,The ‘independence day’ of payments law? Fintech’s impact on financial regulation in Japan,2020.0,Banking; Financial regulation; Fintech; Japan; Payment,"Fintech has been a buzzword in Japan since 2015. The fintech business model in Japan is similar as in other countries: crowdfunding, cryptocurrency, blockchain, AI, Big Data, and cashless payments. What has been the largest impact of fintech in Japan? At first glance, fintech seems to require a change in the financial regulation framework, but this is not the case. In Japan, traditional financial regulation is piecemeal or trident, with a separate legislative framework for banking, insurance, and securities. This framework is not unreasonable because it is designed to respond to different risks. Of course, some other new financial businesses appeared before fintech, and regulation responded to the new risk. Fintech is not a completely new business but just the unbundling of current financial businesses. Especially, payment became more independent from banking today, thanks to the fintech movement. Therefore, regulation just for payment is required more clearly. Currently, the FSA is planning to create a new category of regulation for it. It seems fintech requires a change in the basic framework of financial law. But both in practice and in theory, a pure payment service has attracted attention before fintech. Therefore, fintech, or any other technological innovation, does not require a complete change of regulation but a clarification of current law. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85090256242

In the banking sector, the main focus is on the development of internet-only banking. Under the strict regulations on the separation of financial capital and industrial capital, technological companies’ entry into the banking business causes serious banking law debates. In capital markets, the application of the fintech model in capital markets such as equity and debt-based crowdfunding and robo-advisors is widely discussed. Easy payment & remittance and crypto-assets are a concern for both legal practitioners and the business sector. The legal character and function of crypto-assets is also a significant issue in Korea. In Korea, institutional efforts to introduce new financial products and services in accordance with the combination of technology and finance are being developed in various fields such as banking and securities. Particularly noteworthy is the introduction of new means of payment. The regulatory sandbox newly introduced by Korea will have an impact on the Korean financial regulatory system, which has traditionally been very conservative.

Such businesses have advantages in technology, deliver financial solutions with modern technologies, and provide customers with a highly accessible and streamlined path to fulfill their financial needs. Vietnam has been considered as a potentially lucrative market for fintech as it has a young and ‘tech-savvy’ population, high mobile phone and internet penetration rates, and relatively low levels of financial inclusion. Although its fintech market is still fledgling, more than 150 companies have joined with increasing transaction volumes and high growth rates. They have provided customers with financial and banking services such as digital payment, crowdfunding, peer-to-peer lending, remittance, blockchain, personal finance management, and information comparison with modern technologies, lower costs, and more straightforward procedures. Also, the country has been making an effort to spur the development of fintech companies by setting up a fintech steering committee, preparing the national financial inclusion strategy, and cautiously seeking the best approach to regulate fintech.

Donald D.C.,Hong Kong’s fintech automation: Economic benefits and social risks,2020.0,Automation; Financial regulation; Fintech; Hong Kong,"This chapter examines the rise of fintech, its regulation, and the particular challenges these present for an international financial center (IFC), specifically an IFC with limited economic breadth. Fintech offers automation opportunities for financial institutions, and such automation will in most cases make banks more competitive and lower their labor needs. The Hong Kong government has actively embraced fintech to ensure competitiveness, and its regulation tracks leading international positions on ICOs, cryptocurrency and electronic payment. However, Hong Kong regulators have not facilitated fintech activities that would stimulate the local economy, such as equity crowdfunding. Automation will generally translate into a reduction of human labor, particularly in mid-level jobs. In a large and varied economy, persons laid off from jobs at banks can seek engagement elsewhere. This is not necessarily true in an IFC with a less diversified economy. Hong Kong presents the highly unusual case of persons in a small IFC who have access to a large and diverse economy in mainland China yet may refuse to seek new positions in the larger workplace for cultural or political reasons. The Hong Kong government has blithely followed a ‘market leads, government facilitates’ philosophy of laissez-faire for decades and thus also has failed to prepare for the social costs of fintech. While such preparation would indeed constitute social planning, an activity generally discouraged in Hong Kong, circumstances dictate that the HKSAR government begin to act socially, rather than merely facilitate the largest businesses. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85090253852

In the time series forecasting task, we experimented with three types of methods with different entry points, namely recurrent neural networks with gate structure, networks combining time and frequency domain information, and network structures using attention mechanism. In the trading strategy part, the buying and selling signals and the corresponding trading volume are established according to the prediction results, and trading is conducted with the frequency of hours. In the empirical exploration part, we tested the prediction effect and strategic rate of return of various models on the copper contract. The data shows that in general, the best strategy can obtain a relatively stable income growth that has nothing to do with market fluctuations, but lacks countermeasures for rare external events with greater impact. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089722556

Takanashi Y.,Future of finance: From g20 to practical implementation of multi-stakeholder governance on blockchain based finance,2020.0,Blockchain; Decentralized finance; Governance,"Financial regulators regulate financial intermediaries and activities to achieve their regulatory goals and, in so doing, address various market failures. These objectives are needed in the social interest regardless of the technologies used by the financial system. The blockchain-based financial system, however, has characteristics that could undermine the ability of regulators to achieve regulatory goals. Thus, financial regulators must discover ways to continue to achieve regulatory goals. This situation is similar to the case of telecommunication regulators during the rise of the Internet. In the face of such difficulties in cyberspace, it was suggested to invoke not just law but also social norms, market mechanisms, and architecture to achieve a certain level of oversight. Now, G20 financial regulators recognize the need for cooperation with other stakeholders. Because code embedded in a blockchain system could determine the level of oversight within a blockchain-based financial system, regulators should consider ways to cooperate with engineering communities to develop codes that appropriately facilitate mechanisms to achieve regulatory goals and must empower society to use such codes in order to achieve regulatory goals, which requires consideration on alignment with social norms and market competitiveness. Thus, regulators must cooperate with other stakeholders, including businesses and users. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089504453
"Dupuis D., Gleason K.",Money laundering with cryptocurrency: open doors and the regulatory dialectic,2020.0,AML; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrency; Internal controls; KYC; Money laundering; Regulatory Dialectic,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to describe the opportunities and limitations of cryptocurrencies as a tool for money laundering through six currently available “open doors” (exchange mechanisms). The authors link the regulatory dialectic paradigm to know your customer and anti-money laundering evasion techniques, highlight six tactics to launder funds with virtual assets and investigate potential law enforcement and regulatory alternates used to reduce the incidence of money laundering with digital coins. Design/methodology/approach: The methodology used is the analysis of significant recent events and the availability of “fintech” crime-fighting tools and a literature review focusing on the application of the regulatory dialectic to innovations in existing crypto-asset markets that make them compelling to money launderers. Findings: The authors examine the illicit use of cryptocurrency through Kane’s regulatory dialectic paradigm, identify a number of avenues for crypto to fiat exchange that are still available for those seeking to launder money using digital coins, review recently “closed doors” and make recommendations regarding the regulation of crypto-related markets that may assist in making them less desirable for potential criminals. Research limitations/implications: The research is constrained by the state of the market for crypto to fiat exchange as of time of writing; the technology and products to launder money using these open doors is continually changing (as predicted by the regulatory dialectic). Social implications: The regulatory dialectic predicts that regulatory response is reactive and often increasingly burdensome or oppressive. There is continuous innovation in the cryptocurrency market, which seeks to preserve privacy and anonymity with which regulators seek to keep up. From a social perspective, the response of bank regulators worldwide to existing open doors for crypto to fiat exchange used for money laundering may prove costly to individuals engaging in legitimate transactions, as well as financial criminals and may also erode the ability of individuals to maintain privacy regarding their financial information. Originality/value: To the authors’ knowledge, there are yet no broad overview regarding the feasibility of money laundering across crypto-related assets within the paradigm of the regulatory dialectic. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85089474852

As banks based in the Global North have moved to withdraw financial services from many emerging economies, de-risking has attracted attention for undermining financial inclusion and developmental efforts. Novel technologies are being harnessed to address this problem, including applications of blockchain, the digital ledgers of transactions originally underpinning cryptocurrencies. Contributing to IR theorising of legitimacy and re-risking, this article illustrates how technology-based de-risking efforts that seek to attend to the perceptions of foreign financiers can undermine the legitimacy of financial inclusion projects. Contrasting unfolding blockchain-based financial inclusion initiatives in two regions of small states in the Eastern Caribbean and Eastern Europe, our analysis stresses the need for greater local participation and clearer distribution of benefits from finance and technology (fintech) centred forms of digital development. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85089452177

ICO proponents are usually teams made up by entrepreneurs, professionals, technicians and managers, eventually assisted by an advisory committee. In this work, we analyse the determinants of the characteristics of the advisory board and using different centrality and connectedness measures from social network analysis we analyse the relationship with the ICO fundraising success. We find that larger and more experienced teams are more likely to appoint a committee of advisors and its presence is significantly correlated with the ICO success. Different facets of the ICO centrality in the advisors’ network are associated to different effects. We find a U-shaped relationship between the number of advisors’ connections, their capability to act as ‘bridges’ in the network and the ICO success; we also find that, in order to raise larger amount of money, it is important to hire advisors which are linked to ‘well-connected’ advisors in other ICOs and are more closely linked to all other nodes in the network. © 2020 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85089157332

Consequently, most adults around the world are classified as financial illiterate (FI). Billions of individuals belonging to low-income populations (LIPs) do not have the means to plan for retirement. Regardless, they are often measured through the same FL Measurements (FLMs) and classified as FIs. LIPs are not necessarily incapable of making financial decisions, but FLMs do not necessarily fit their context, making it an inappropriate measurement. Moreover, FinTech is increasing the financial options that LIPs have. It is thus relevant to create an appropriate measurement that addresses this inadequacy.

Reshef Kera D.,Sandboxes and testnets as “trading zones” for blockchain governance,2020.0,Blockchain; Governance; Regulatory sandbox,"FinTech regulatory sandboxes and testnets use cases offer a hybrid model for integrating blockchain technologies with governance, connecting code with regulations, on-chain infrastructure with off-chain institutions. The hybrid models are an alternative to the reduction of governance to consensus mechanisms in the present libertarian but also anarcho-capitalist and communitarian blockchain projects. Inspired by the concepts of “innovation through dissonance” in the so-called “trading zones,” we claim that the regulatory sandboxes can integrate all four regulatory forces (law, social norms, market, and technical infrastructure) rather than only two (FinTech insistence on markets and technology). This evaluation criterium for sandboxes was defined and tested with a simulated ledger (testnet) for exploring near-future scenarios of blockchain governance. In 2019, we conducted five workshops with 35 participants using templates of smart contracts to decide upon regulations of novel services that use satellite data to trigger automatic transactions (change of ownership). In the workshop and following questionnaire, the participants expressed need for a better integration of their natural language, regulations, and code without prioritizing any regulatory force or domain (market, culture, technology, or law), but supporting what we describe as a playful “regulation through dissonance.” © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85088744451

"Al-Shaibani H., Lasla N., Abdallah M.",Consortium Blockchain-Based Decentralized Stock Exchange Platform,2020.0,Blockchain; smart contract; stock exchange; trading,"The global implementation architecture of the traditional stock market distributes responsibilities and data across different intermediaries, including financial and governmental organizations. Each organization manages its system and collaborates with the others to facilitate trading on the stock exchange platform, and typically buy-sell orders go through different parties before settlement. This design architecture that involves a complex chain of intermediaries has several limitations and shortcomings, such as a single point of failure, a longer time for financial settlements, and weak transparency. Blockchain technology consists of a network of computer nodes that securely share a common ledger without the need of having any kind of intermediaries. In this paper, we present a novel blockchain-based architecture for a fully decentralized stock market. Our architecture is based on a private Ethereum blockchain to create a consortium network leveraging organizations that are already involved in the traditional stock exchange to act as validating nodes. In our architecture, the stock exchange trading logic is completely implemented on a smart contract, while considering the existing governmental market regulations. Since the new platform does not introduce significant changes to the stock exchange trading logic and does not eliminate any of the traditional parties from the system, our proposal promotes efficient adoption and deployment of decentralized stock exchange platforms. In addition, we present a proof of concept implementation of the new architecture, including the smart contract for trade exchange, as well as a virtualization-based test network to assess the platform performance. The test network consists of virtual nodes that run the developed stock exchange smart contract where we measure the buy-sell orders throughput and latency under different network sizes and trading workload scenarios. The obtained results have shown that the proposed trading platform can reach a throughput of 311.8 tx/sec, which is equivalent to 89% of the optimal throughput when the sending rate is 350 tx/sec. This throughput is largely sufficient to meet the requirement of major stock exchanges, such as Singapore stock market. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85088690197

At its most fundamental level the answer to these matters will determine the regulatory framework within which trading in cryptocurrencies may or may not occur. The government may simply prohibit trading in cryptocurrencies, even making such transactions illegal. Alternatively, trading may not only be legal, but facilitated by government concessions. A government may recognise cryptocurrencies as 'currency'. It may be determined that transactions involving cryptocurrencies merely involve the sale of property, possibly akin to a financial product. This article discusses the different approaches to regulating cryptocurrency and the taxation implications in four Asian countries which account for a large proportion of cryptocurrency transactions. © 2020 University of New South Wales.",Article,2-s2.0-85087937199
Tharp D.T.,Potential Consumer Harm Due to Regulation on Financial Advisory Communication in the FinTech Age,2020.0,communication; consumer protection; financial advice; planner–client relationship; record keeping; regulation,"This article examines potential consumer harm that may arise due to regulating modern financial services communication technology with rules written in the early 20th century. It is argued that disparities in record keeping regulation across communication mediums disincentivizes the use of technology capable of generating records for consumer retention, while incentivizing the use of technology which shields financial advisors from accountability. Experimental evidence is provided in support of this argument. Further, it is argued that regulation disparities across communication mediums may result in more wrongful accusations of advisor misconduct, less reporting of genuine misconduct, less self-policing among industry members, and greater unrectifiable consumer harm. Objections to these arguments are considered, along with practical guidance for consumers, regulators, and policy makers. © Copyright 2020 Association for Financial Counseling and Planning Education, U.S.A.",Article,2-s2.0-85087927225

"Yeh J.-Y., Chen C.-H.",A machine learning approach to predict the success of crowdfunding fintech project,2020.0,Big data; Crowdfunding; Ensemble neural network; Fintech; Machine learning; Social capital,"Purpose: The crowdfunding market has experienced rapid growth in recent years. However, not all projects are successfully financed because of information asymmetries between the founder and the providers of external finance. This shortfall in funding has made factors that lead to successful fundraising, a great interest to researchers. This study draws on the social capital theory, human capital theory and level of processing (LOP) theory to predict the success of crowdfunding projects. Design/methodology/approach: A feature set is extracted and correlations between project success and features are utilized to order the features. The artificial neural network (ANN) is popularly applied to analyze the dependencies of the input variables to improve the accuracy of prediction. However, the problem of overfitting may exist in such neural networks. This study proposes a neural network method based on ensemble machine learning and dropout methods to generate several neural networks for preventing the problem of overfitting. Four machine learning techniques are applied and compared for prediction performance. Findings: This study shows that the success of crowdfunding projects can be predicted by measuring and analyzing big data of social media activity, human capital of funders and online project presentation. The ensemble neural network method achieves highest accuracy. The investments rose from early projects and another platform by the funder serve as credible indicators for later investors. Practical implications: The managerial implication of this study is that the project founders and investors can apply the proposed model to predict the success of crowdfunding projects. This study also identifies the most influential features that affect fundraising outcomes. The project funders can use these features to increase the successful opportunities of crowdfunding project. Originality/value: This study contributes to apply a new machine learning modeling method to extract features from activity data of crowdfunding platforms and predict crowdfunding project success. In addition, it contributes to the research on the deployment of social capital, human capital and online presentation strategies in a crowdfunding context as well as offers practical implications for project funders and investors. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85087887565

The subject aims at increasing the efficiency of existing processes and the institutional side of the industry is really interested. And in some ways, this is a breakthrough. This article elaborates on the current status quo and future path of the industry. Design/methodology/approach: The real estate industry is evolving, and parts of the business are increasingly being conquered by “proptechs” and “fintechs”. They have come into real estate to stay not because they discovered inefficiencies in the way one manages and does business with real estate, but because they come with an arsenal of new technologies that can change the whole game. The article discusses a path for changing the game in real estate. Findings: “location, location, location” has now evolved to “data, data, data”. However, there is one essential aspect that must be considered before the latter can become the real value creator: the ability of market players to analyse data. And this does not mean being an excellent Excel user. The near future sees a solution called Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) meaning that the econometric world constructed decades ago has an expiry date.

"Ma Y., Han R., Wang W.",Prediction-Based Portfolio Optimization Models Using Deep Neural Networks,2020.0,Deep neural network; prediction-based portfolio; semi-absolute deviation,"Portfolio optimization is a hot research topic, which has attracted many researchers in recent decades. Better portfolio optimization model can help investors earn more stable profits. This paper uses three deep neural networks (DNNs), i.e., deep multilayer perceptron (DMLP), long short memory (LSTM) neural network and convolutional neural network (CNN) to build prediction-based portfolio optimization models which own the advantages of both deep learning technology and modern portfolio theory. These models first use DNNs to predict each stock's future return. Then, predictive errors of DNNs are applied to measure the risk of each stock. Next, the portfolio optimization models are built by integrating the predictive returns and semi-absolute deviation of predictive errors. These models are compared with three equal weighted portfolios, where their stocks are selected by DMLP, LSTM neural network and CNN respectively. Also, two prediction-based portfolio models built with support vector regression are used as benchmarks. This paper applies component stocks of China securities 100 index in Chinese stock market as experimental data. Experimental results present that the prediction-based portfolio model based on DMLP performs the best among these models under different desired portfolio returns, and high desired portfolio return can further improve the performance of this model.

There is ease of digital unsecured loans and fast process due to online-based credit applications. However, these facilities are followed by high-interest loans. It is not in accordance with the real spirit of fintech that supposed to be to create economic efficiency by cutting high transaction costs in the conventional financial system. In turn, people in many household sectors apply for digital unsecured loans without considering risk. This phenomenon has to increase potential bad loans in the household sector. Finally, it will disrupt the stability of financial system as a whole. This research aims to conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the effect of digital unsecured loans and the DTI ratio on changes in risk-taking behavior of the household sectors. Research data collection was carried out through 2 × 2 between-subjects experimental methods. Experiments were carried out using paper and pencil tests. The experimental task given is a simulation of short-term credit applications. ANOVA test results show that the presence of digital unsecured loans increases the household sector risk-taking behavior, the DTI ratio can be used as an individual internal control to prevent increased risk-taking behavior in the digital era. © 2020 Innovare Academics Sciences Pvt.

Kumar Chandar S.,Grey Wolf optimization-Elman neural network model for stock price prediction,2020.0,Average relative variance; Bio-inspired algorithm; Elman neural network; Grey Wolf optimization; Stock prediction,"Over the past two decades, assessing future price of stock market has been a very active area of research in financial world. Stock price always fluctuates due to many variables. Thus, an accurate prediction of stock price can be considered as a tough task. This study intends to design an efficient model for predicting future price of stock market using technical indicators derived from historical data and natural inspired algorithm. The model adopts Elman neural network (ENN) because of its ability to memorize the past information, which is suitable for solving stock problems. Trial and error-based method is widely used to determine the parameters of ENN. It is a time-consuming task. To address such an issue, this study employs Grey Wolf optimization (GWO) algorithm to optimize the parameters of ENN. Optimized ENN is utilized to predict the future price of stock data in 1 day advance. To evaluate the prediction efficiency, proposed model is tested on NYSE and NASDAQ stock data. The efficacy of the proposed model is compared with other benchmark models such as FPA-ELM, PSO-MLP, PSOElman,CSO-ARMA and GA-LSTM to prove its superiority. Results demonstrated that the GWO-ENN model provides accurate prediction for 1 day ahead prediction and outperforms the benchmark models taken for comparison. © 2020, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85087739609

The analysis of order flow provides many challenges that can be addressed by Machine Learning (ML) techniques in order to determine an optimal dynamic trading strategy. The first step in this direction is represented by the outcome analysis of order flow: the model should identify strong predictors that determine a positive/negative outcome. The aim of this work is the proposal of a closed-loop ML approach based on decision tree (DT) model to perform outcome analysis on financial trading data. The overall approach is integrated in a Decision Support System for Outcome Analysis (DSS-OA). Taking into account the model complexity, the DT algorithm enables to generate explanations that allow the user to understand (i) how this outcome is reached (decision rules) and (ii) the most discriminative outcome predictors (feature importance). The closed-loop approach allows the users to interact directly with the proposed DSS-OA by retraining the algorithm with the goal to a finer-grained outcome analysis. The experimental results and comparisons demonstrated high-interpretability and predictive performance of the proposed DSS-OA by providing a valid and fast system for outcome analysis on financial trading data. Moreover, the Proof of Concept evaluation demonstrated the impact of the proposed DSS-OA in the outcome analysis scenario. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85087339443

Reimbursement loans are often used to credit the trade of overseas goods. The reason of such case is that the shipment of goods by the maritime transport requires a significant amount of time and those trades are often associated with high financial amounts. Since international trade (exchange) is a kind of a generator of society’s progress, it is necessary to explore the possibilities for making international payment cheaper, more efficient and more secure. In this case, we based our research on the implementation of modern technologies, more precisely “blockchain”/DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) and “smart contracts”. The new reimbursement loan model presented in the paper is based on the aforementioned technologies. It could potentially change not only the documentary lending techniques, but also, eventually, overall financial paradigm. The effectiveness of the application of modern technologies is proven comparing the results of the so called conventional and unconventional reimbursement credit model on a real case involving two companies in Indonesia and Singapore. The paper also tackles on the further implementation of “smart contract” technology and “blockchain”/DLT, thus considering the potential impact of these technologies on overseas trade, credit markets and financial institutions. Finally, the paper argues on the limitations in implementing this new technique (e.g. legal, political and technical challenges). © Faculty of Maritime Studies Rijeka, 2020.",Review,2-s2.0-85087163998

Among these studies the best techniques use neural networks as a prediction tool. More specifically, the best networks for this purpose are called recurrent neural networks (RNN) and provide an extra option when dealing with a sequence of values. However, a great part of the studies is intended to predict the result of few stocks, therefore, this work aims to predict the behavior of a large number of stocks. For this, similar stocks were grouped based on their correlation and later the algorithm K-means was applied so that similar groups were clustered. After this process, the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) - a type of RNN - was used in order to predict the price of a certain group of assets.

Following the 2008–09 crisis, China and other emerging markets and developing economies obtained formal membership in the forums of global financial regulatory governance. Has their incorporation changed global regulatory politics? We analyze the epistemic contestation, bargaining, and persuasion surrounding the latest item on the financial regulatory reform agenda of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board: non-bank credit intermediation. Our study identifies three groups of norm entrepreneurs with different epistemic backgrounds that advance partially overlapping and competing interpretative frames of how to define, understand, and regulate this amorphous financial (non-)sector. Regulators from Western advanced economies took the lead in defining non-bank finance as stability-threatening shadow banking, successfully asserting epistemic authority against alternative frames advanced by China and other developing countries that include developmental prerogatives. Confronted with this impasse, Chinese authorities have sought to re-frame non-bank finance at the G20 under the label of digital financial inclusion. Our findings challenge and refine salient theories of global regulatory politics and underscore the importance of epistemic concerns for debates over the consequences of the entry of new actors from the ‘Global South’ into the core institutions of global financial governance. © 2020, © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85086779796

This research is motivated by the fact that, in contrast to leading financial and banking centres that attract considerable research attention, small banking centres have remained under-researched, despite their large number and the important role they play in their host communities and regions. This paper deals with the recent evolutionary dynamics of 199 small European banking centres and is based on an analysis of the economic performance of individual banks aggregated at the city level where they have their headquarters. The analysed indicators cover size, profitability and the level of risk of particular banks over the 2004–2015 period. In addition, the data were analysed for three basic European macro-regions (western Europe, southern Europe and central and eastern Europe) and in terms of the ownership of the banks headquartered in particular centres (foreign versus domestic). Our investigation shows that, even though a significant decline has been observed in the number of these centres, the financial performance of banks headquartered in small financial centres differs widely, depending significantly upon the European macro-region (a decisive number of defunct banking centres was concentrated in southern Europe) and the ownership structure. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,2-s2.0-85086771430

Market segmentation is a widely used approach in investigating the heterogeneity of customer buying behavior and profitability. It is important to note that conventional market segmentation models in the retail industry are predominantly descriptive methods, lack sufficient market insights, and often fail to identify sufficiently small segments. This study also takes advantage of the dynamics involved in the Hadoop distributed file system for its ability to process vast dataset. Three different market segmentation experiments using modified best fit regression, i.e., Expectation-Maximization (EM) and K-Means++ clustering algorithms were conducted and subsequently assessed using cluster quality assessment. The results of this research are twofold: i) The insight on customer purchase behavior revealed for each Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) segment; ii) performance of the clustering algorithm for producing accurate market segments. The analysis indicated that the average lifetime of the customer was only two years, and the churn rate was 52%.

Additionally, the importance of new knowledge created in the financial services sector (IT sector) increases (decreases) as fintech start-ups grow and seek financing. When the level of trust in financial services incumbents falls within a region, this is followed by an increase in the financing provided to fintech start-ups.

Nairobi is Kenya’s largest and most developed city, but it is also the city where the country’s largest slum is located. The city’s poorest strata, the so-called urban poor, account for a large proportion of Nairobi’s population; most of them face exclusion from accessing formal financial services. However, mobile money has enabled them to access financial services more easily. Based on survey research conducted by the author in Nairobi, this paper demonstrates that the urban poor were far less likely to have a bank account than middle- and high-income groups, but that they had a high need for saving services/safe money storage. Mobile money has provided a savings service that is better suited to the needs of the urban poor than that offered by other channels and has enabled them to save small amount of money more frequently. This has encouraged greater use of mobile money and has significantly decreased levels of financial exclusion amongst the urban poor (p <.001). © 2020, © 2020 African Journal of Science, Technology, Innovation and Development.",Article,2-s2.0-85086320473
Serrano W.,The random neural network in price predictions,2020.0,Artificial Intelligence; Fintech; Price predictions; Random Neural Network; Stock market,"Everybody likes to make a good prediction, in particular, when some sort of personal investment is involved in terms of finance, energy or time. The difficulty is to make a prediction that optimises the reward obtained from the original contribution; this is even more important when investments are the core service offered by a business or pension fund generated by monthly contributions. The complexity of finance is that the human predictor may have other interests or bias than the human investor, the trust between predictor and investor will never be completely established as the investor will never know if the predictor has generated, intentionally or unintentionally, the optimum possible reward. This paper presents the Random Neural Network in recurrent configuration that makes predictions on time series data, specifically, prices. The biological model inspired by the brain structure and neural interconnections makes predictions entirely on previous data from the time series rather than predictions based on several uncorrelated inputs. The model is validated against the property, stock and Fintech market: 1) UK property prices, 2) stock markets indice prices, 3) cryptocurrency prices.

The introduction of new technologies has allowed technology companies, far from the financial services market, to make payments and settlements with their customers, to provide services for capital management, insurance and lending. Until now, banks have played a dominant role in the financial services market, but with the development of electronic and information technologies, large technology companies are able to compete with them. Technology companies have certain advantages over banks, as can provide services at the expense of lower cost, as well as to develop business in the poorest areas, where banks work unprofitable. New technology companies are beginning to introduce business based on big Data platforms and technology, which implies the need to change risk management approaches. Technology companies can effectively assess the creditworthiness of borrowers on the basis of large amounts of information, reducing the need to use collateral as collateral for transactions. At the same time, technology companies can introduce new types of risks to the financial market, as they are not involved in standard refinancing procedures and only formally comply with consumer protection rules.

"Arli D., van Esch P., Bakpayev M., Laurence A.",Do consumers really trust cryptocurrencies?,2020.0,Anxiety; Bitcoin; Cryptocurrencies; Knowledge; Marketing; Trust,"Purpose: In this study, we focus on consumer perceptions of cryptocurrencies. We hypothesize that knowledge of cryptocurrencies, trust in government, and the speed of transactions are the main factors contributing to consumers' trust in cryptocurrencies. Design/methodology/approach: 451 MTurk workers, a convenient sample incentivized with a small monetary payment, participated in a cross-sectional online study with cryptocurrencies serving as the focal product category. Findings: We obtained support for our hypothesized notion that knowledge of cryptocurrencies, trust in government, and the speed of transactions are the main factors contributing to consumers' trust in cryptocurrencies. Our research makes several important theoretical contributions. First, we demonstrate that consumers who understand and know how cryptocurrencies work are more likely to trust and invest in the currency. Next, we demonstrate that consumers are more likely to trust cryptocurrencies and their peer-to-peer transactions if, preferably, they take place via a central issuer and are regulated by their respective governments. Originality/value: This study is the first known paper to focus on cryptocurrencies from the consumers' perspective. Next, we identify key antecedents of trust towards cryptocurrencies. Second, we reveal the role of government concerning cryptocurrencies. Finally, FinTech firms and banks (should they choose to enter the cryptocurrency market) need not spend time and money on marketing, advertising, and promotions in order to try to allay consumers' anxiety when it comes to their uptake in the different digital currencies. Rather, this would allow the FinTech firms and banks to allocate resources to focus their attention on marketing, advertising and promoting the factors (i.e. knowledge, trust in government, and speed of transaction) that drive intent to invest in cryptocurrencies. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85086156912

In particular, the field of automation of financial advice has considerable relevance: the robo-advice and its “subspecies” (“pure”, mixed, “robo for advisors”) allow us to ask ourselves about the qualification of the existing relationship and that involves the investor, on the remedies available to him/her in the event of relationship disorders and liability profiles. This last aspect presents an element of complication due to the new “factors” introduced by the AI in the structure of the relationship, no longer simplified as direct and exclusive between two human beings. It is therefore necessary to investigate the possible development guidelines and to ask whether there is already, in the current legal system, an adequate regulatory framework or whether, alternatively, a direct intervention by the legislator is necessary. We could have: new interests on which to ask oneself about their legal recognition; or ways for a better pursuit of the already recognized interests thanks to new technologies; or again, the needs for regulatory intervention aimed to set up new cases of better protection of the same interests. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85086131304

In this paper, we study the portfolio optimization problem in the Vietnamese stock market by using deep-learning methodologies and one dataset collected from the Ho Chi Minh City Stock Exchange (VN-HOSE) from the beginning of the year 2013 to the middle of the year 2019. We aim to construct an efficient algorithm that can find the portfolio having the highest Sharpe ratio in the next coming weeks. To overcome this challenge, we propose a novel loss function and transform the original problem into a supervised problem. The input data can be determined as a 3D tensor, while the predicted output is the unnormalized weighted proportion for each ticker in the portfolio to maximize the daily return Y of the stock market after a given number of days. We compare different deep learning models, including Residual Networks (ResNet), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Self-Attention (SA), Additive Attention (AA), and various combinations: SA + LSTM, SA + GRU, AA + LSTM, and AA + GRU. The experimental results show that the AA + GRU outperforms the rest of the methods on the Sharpe ratio and provides promising results for the portfolio optimization problem not only in Vietnam but also in other countries. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85085740080

Through experimentation with the platform business model and building on the digital infrastructures and data flows of the broader platform ecosystem, a constellation of organisations–including start-ups, early-career firms, BigTech companies and incumbent banks–are engaged in processes of platform reintermediation. Changing the bases of competition in retail money and financial markets and encouraging oligopoly and even monopoly, the reintermediation processes of FinTech are presently manifest in strong tendencies towards platform consolidation.

One emerging technology within this field is cryptocurrency, aiming to change the future means of payment. In this paper, we study Bitcoin exchange trading and examine what factors influence the behavior of different cryptocurrency investor types. To answer this question, market bids are considered in form of investors' offers and orders as a proxy for their trading behavior. First, an unsupervised clustering technique is applied in order to group different types of investors based on similarities in trading behavior. Second, a supervised classification mechanism is used on social media news to measure the sentiment influencing trading decisions. Among other indicators this bullishness is integrated in an autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model to identify the factors influencing the trading behavior of investor types. Besides large investors, foreign traders and speculators, cryptocurrency-specific market participants are characterized in the form of miners. With identifying indicators driving investors' actions (i.e., macro-financial fundamentals, technical trading indicators, technological measures and market sentiment), this study contributes to recent research by explaining the trading behavior on cryptocurrency markets and its impact on exchange rates. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

We propose a two-stage analytical model that takes into account the value-risk tradeoff in the new payment system design, as well as banks' participation incentives and adoption timing decisions. We find that, as the system base value increases, banks tend to synchronize their investment and adoption decisions. When the system base value is low and banks are heterogeneous, bank association ownership maximizes social welfare. When both the system base value and bank heterogeneity are moderate, government mandate leads to the socially optimal solution. When the system base value is high and banks are relatively homogenous, government ownership is socially optimal. We offer important policy implications regarding the optimal system design and the government regulator's role in shaping the banking industry in future financial innovation. © 40th International Conference on Information Systems, ICIS 2019.

Design/methodology/approach: An international, two-stage Delphi study with 20 projections is used. Findings: According to the experts, blockchain applications will be primarily based on permissioned or consortium blockchains. Blockchain-based applications will integrate Internet of Things devices in the power grid, manage the e-mobility infrastructure, automate billing and direct payment and issue certificates regarding the origin of electricity. Blockchain solutions are expected to play an important big role in fostering peer-to-peer trading in microgrids, further democratizing and decentralizing the energy sector. New regulatory frameworks become necessary. Research limitations/implications: The Delphi study’s scope is rather broad than narrow and detailed. Further studies should focus on partial scenarios. Practical implications: Electricity market participants should build blockchain-based competences and collaborate in current pilot projects. Social implications: Blockchain technology will further decentralize the energy sector and probably reduce transaction costs. Originality/value: Despite the assumed importance of blockchain technology, no coherent foresight study on its use and implications exists yet. This study closes this research gap. © 2020, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85084441768

Fintech events of Chinese large commercial banks between 2016 and 2019 are taken as research samples, and the research shows that the release of the Fintech has a positive effect on commercial bank's stock price but has a time lag. From the short-term perspective, after the fourth day, the event began to bring statistically significant and positive effect to the commercial stock price, and until the eighth day, the positive impact of the event was biggest. Also, the abnormal return rate CAR (Cumulative average abnormal return) brought by Fintech events is negatively correlated with the banks' market prices and ROE (Return on Equity), and is positively correlated with the length of listing, and has no statistically significant correlation with SOE (state-owned sized enterprise). © 2020 Inderscience Enterprises Ltd..

"Dia M., Takouda P.M., Golmohammadi A.",Assessing the performance of Canadian credit unions using a three-stage network bootstrap DEA,2020.0,Bootstrapping; Credit unions; Data envelopment analysis; Financial crisis; Network DEA; Relative efficiency,"We use a novel three-stage network data envelopment analysis (DEA) model (based on production, intermediation, and revenue generation operations) with bootstrapping to evaluate the performance of 14 of the largest Canadian credit unions for the period 2007–2017 and the impact of various events on this performance. For each analysis, we contrast the results of the network DEA with those of a black box DEA. We show that the former provides more insightful information regarding the sources of the inefficiencies. We first found that while overall, the credit unions showed high-efficiency ratios, there is room for improvement, especially for the production sub-process. Moreover, the efficiency of individual credit unions is not consistent across the three different stages. Through the years 2007–2017, the credit union system exhibits a relatively sharp decline in its efficiency, mainly due to managerial issues at the revenue generation stage. Our analyses show that the various stages of Canadian credit union operations have been affected by the 2007–2009 financial crisis, the low policy interest rates that occurred in the following years, and the fact that in Canada, the federal government has eliminated the discount on the federal tax rate. The credit unions can improve their performance at the different stages by exploring Fintech Solutions to reduce their operating costs, seeking a better mix of loans and securities investments, and improving their interest and saving rate settings. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85083865243

Design/Methodology/Approach: In this paper we evolve possible approaches of FinTech legal definition, investigate existing approaches at the international level and examine the policies applied at the national levels. Document analysis, as a form of qualitative research, was used in this study. Findings: We found that in most countries the legislation does not specifically address fintech companies, and the legal framework equally regulates the activities of traditional service providers and fintech operators. In our opinion, no specific legislation for FinTech companies needed, each type of activity provided by a financial or technology company is subject to a specific legislation/regulation with primary focus on services and products provided as payments, insurance, investments etc. Practical Implications: The term FinTech is freely used by policy makers, regulators, companies, researchers, academics and the public, both nationally and internationally. According to international organizations such as the IMF, the World Bank and the OECD, FinTech offers the opportunity to accelerate economic growth and expand financial affordability/inclusion in all countries. Some countries are increasingly striving to become global or international regional hubs for FinTech and are working hard to develop interagency government strategies with a supportive legal environment. Originality/Value: There is still confusion about the nature and dynamics of FinTech among politicians, scientists and practitioners, as well as about the legal framework of this area. The value of this article is to clarify and propose an apprach to definition of FinTech by combining different approaches in a very original and innovative way. © 2020 International Strategic Management Association.

Despite multiple initiatives and regulatory changes, there is a need to revisit the reporting and regulatory frameworks and redefine the focus areas. Banks credit problem has often been explored under the lens of asymmetric information. Spreads are generally directly proportional to probability of default and an inverse function of collateral and security. However, in India, there is a noticeable gap in academic literature to suggest robust institutional reforms to address the twin curse of adverse selection and moral hazard. Regulatory frameworks, particularly with respect to risk management function of banks, also grapple with predicting forthcoming disruptions. As banks redesign their corporate customer experience on a digitalized scale, leveraging large-scale available data, there is a bigger challenge to the regulator to ensure risk regulations are effective and save costs as well. The authors suggest that if information asymmetry exists, the blockchain protocols may mitigate uncertainty. Though blockchain technology has been leveraged to increase effectiveness of certain corporate banking products, the originality of the paper lies in coming out with a detailed framework for the possible use of blockchain (a distributed ledger based technology) for credit decisions, timely generation of red-flags and tightening the regulatory framework. The paper also lists down suggestions to improve the enabling regulatory and reporting architecture using regulatory technology (RegTech) to support unification of data already available in the banking system. This will improve the quality of information available to the lenders and enable them to take more informed credit decisions (data-driven finance), while granting and monitoring loans. Ultimately, it will lead to an optimization of credit risk capital. © 2020, Springer Nature Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85083763943

Using detailed data on the almost 1000 fintech startups in France to date, we find that most fintechs are geographically clustered and that the location of new fintech startups is affected, among other things, by the size of clusters and the presence of incubators. Larger clusters attract more new fintech startups, and incubators are shown to be an effective mechanism to attract new fintech startups. We further examine entrepreneurial exits of fintechs and find that being located in a larger cluster reduces the risk of failure but increases the likelihood of being acquired. Increased competition within a given segment of fintech increases failure rates. Moreover, the risk of failure is significantly lower for fintech startups that have been developed in an incubator. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85082935165

In 2019, the Internet user audience in Russia amounted to 90 million people (75.4% of the country’s adult population). More than 50% of the European population (250 million people) and 40% of the Chinese population (approximately 560 million people) use digital banking in everyday life. Therefore, the protection of the rights of consumers of digital financial services are facing governments of all countries of the world. Design/methodology/approach: In this chapter, the authors studied and analyzed the provisions of legislation, judicial practice, the doctrines of the European Union, the USA, China, and the Russian Federation. Findings: It is shown that the legal regulation of consumer protection of digital financial services should not be too strict and excessive. Excessive regulation causes digital financial service providers to travel to other countries where regulation is milder or absent altogether, which happened in the United States in 2018. The government had to cancel some very tough provisions of Dodd-Frank 2010. On the other hand, the comparatively lenient regulation of the distribution of digital banking services, for example in China, has led to the emergence of a number of fraudulent schemes in the field of Internet banking. Under pressure from the indignant public, the Chinese government had to take urgent measures to rectify the situation Originality/value: The novelty lies in the analysis of a number of regulatory acts, including: acts of the European Union (Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of 27 April 2016 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data; Directive (EU) 2015/2366 on EU-wide payment services (PSD2)); the USA (Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (2010); Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act (2018) (EGRRCPA)); China (General Rules of the Civil Law of China; Law of Consumer Rights and Interests; Cybersecurity Law 2017) and the Russian Federation (Law “On Protection of Consumer Rights” of 07.02.1992 (as amended on March 18, 2019)). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85081660339

Blockchain is being applied in an increasing number of fields. Supply chain finance is a financing model in which banks connect core enterprises with upstream and downstream enterprises to provide flexible financial products and services. In the traditional supply chain finance, the core enterprises with strong competitiveness and a large scale play an irreplaceable role in managing the supply chain information flow, logistics, and capital flow, which results in inequality and information asymmetry. Fraud in supply chain finance is also very serious. To solve the problems of the traditional supply chain finance, in this article, we build a new type of supply chain financial platform that uses blockchain technology to manage the whole process. This supply chain financial platform solves the problem of nontrust among the participants in the supply chain, improves the efficiency of the capital flow and information flow, reduces costs, and provides better financial services to the relevant parties in the supply chain. To protect users' privacy, we propose a new method of using homomorphic encryption in the blockchain to meet the needs of sensitive data privacy protection in supply chain financial scenarios.

Impact on Shadow Deposits in China,2020.0,bank run; E26; E422; fintech; G18; interest rate liberalization; shadow banking,"In this paper we attempt to characterize the stability of shadow deposits in China with interest rate liberalization and fintech developments. We emphasize that shadow banks provide higher but riskier returns and such characteristics affect the stability of shadow deposits. In our setting, the stability of shadow deposits is influenced by two offsetting effects, namely: the patience effect, which makes investors more willing to wait because of the potentially higher returns; and the uncertainty effect, which makes investors more likely to withdraw as a result of higher risk. Under liberalized interest rates, the patience effect will erode and the uncertainty effect will be heightened because the post-liberalization higher return of traditional banks undermines the importance of the extra return of shadow deposits to depositors, while preserving the importance of the risk aspect. Fintech development is modeled as a reduction in the withdrawal cost that facilitates runs. This affects the stability of shadow deposits because of their wider fintech reliance. Regulators should be cautious in pushing interest rate liberalization and fintech application alongside building a safety net for shadow banking. © 2020 Institute of World Economics and Politics, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences",Article,2-s2.0-85079722999

Fintech companies are part of a financial lending infrastructure claiming to offer an alternative to ‘big banks’, and are often touted as digitally disruptive technology that is rapidly reshaping financial inclusion agendas and improving the lives of the poor. For many refugees living in camps and informal settlements in Kenya, fintech is often the only viable option for credit or microfinance aid. While refugees are often excluded from credit, the spread of fintech as a solution for direct peer-to-peer aid transfers from the Global North to refugees has resulted in the uneven distribution of credit access and livelihood support. Through fintech, private citizens and groups in the Global North are able to disrupt and subvert refugee assistance, deeming some worthy of aid while others face ongoing exclusion. While fintech remains a hopeful source of greater efficiency and empowerment, the direct transfer of aid money masks profit and corporate power by only extending assistance to those refugees who are appropriately entrepreneurial, that is to say those who will start small businesses and pay back their loans. This paper argues that processes of financial inclusion carried out by and through fintech are still distinguished largely by exclusion. In so doing, this paper highlights a theoretical position that refugee governance is embedded in racial forms of capital accumulation and expropriation. © The Author(s) 2020.",Article,2-s2.0-85079442101

This paper proposes a blockchain based approach to decentralise the storage of personal data and remove the need to trust a third party. Additionally, our proposed solution focuses on the problem of data ownership which we solve by storing it in an encrypted format which can only be decrypted by the user. In our implementation, the user has his PII (Personally Identifiable Information) on a QR code in an encrypted format, ensuring two-layer security of data. The banks only have access to the data when the customer explicitly gives it to them. Consequently, implementing the proposed system along with the coordination between the banks, the regulator and other stakeholders will ensure an enhanced user experience and save costs for the service providers. © 2020 IJSTR.",Article,2-s2.0-85078760756

These are the attributes of actual availability. It is crucial to identify the most influential attributes to develop an adequate level of worker's performance. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper is to upgrade the Availability-Humanization-Model (AH-Model) with an implementation of the artificial intelligence classification tree to identify influencing factors of the well-being attributes on human performance, where the identified influencing factors are gripping points for maintaining sustainable performance in real-life conditions of different professions. METHODS: Well-being attributes are collected with the Questionnaire Actual Availability (QAA) from AH-Model and then analysed by implementation of the decision trees classification algorithms. An embedded clustering analysis of QAA ensures an efficient feature construction and selection. It negates the need of applying tree pruning or any other noise reduction algorithms. RESULTS: An implementation of the machine learning algorithms reflects the real conditions of working environments: (a) real performance of workers depends on the perception of well-being and availability and (b) the most influencing factors explicitly reflect the content of work in a specific domain (Fintech, health, forestry, traffic) with a high level of stress.

"Chen X., Hu X., Ben S.","How do reputation, structure design and FinTech ecosystem affect the net cash inflow of P2P lending platforms? Evidence from China",2020.0,Cash flow; Ecosystem; P2P lending; Reputation; Structure design,"Based on daily data of 749 active online P2P lending platforms in Chinese market, this study explores the key factors affecting the net cash inflow rate of the platform which is vital for its operation and survival from the perspective of reputation, structure design and FinTech ecosystem. Internal governance issues of P2P lending platforms are further discussed according to the model results. A positive U-shaped relationship has been found between the platform duration and its net cash inflow rate which proves the role of reputation in the long-term development of P2P lending platforms. In addition, we demonstrate that both capital and operational structure design of the platform (e.g. shareholders background, credit assignment, trusteeship and guarantee) have a significant impact on the platform’s net cash inflow rate. The cash flow level of the platform has also been affected by the regional FinTech ecosystem. Platforms in a medium-developing ecosystem may have the highest net cash inflow rate, while a backward ecosystem will lower the cash flows of the platforms located in this area on average. Some suggestions on cash flow management and internal governance of P2P lending platforms for both platform founders and governments are put forward in the end of the study. © 2020, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85078504220
"Malik M.S.H., Azam F., Anwar M.W., Kiran A.",A Meta-Model for Regression Testing of Fintech Web Applications,2020.0,FinTech regression; Metamodel; Regression MetaModel; Regression testing; Web FinTech,"If a web application is migrated or the version of the system is changed then the test scripts becomes incapable of being validated because of the differences in the platform being used in testing. Regression tests need to be applied at that application after migration or version update are required to get written again in order to resolve compatibility issues with the new technologies. A problematic scenario occurs for the automation of script-level test when an application is updated or migrated just to include the technology which is not supported by the tool in use of testing. In this case, the purpose of test automation is eradicated because the scripts for regression testing are rewritten with the scripting language of the new testing tool being utilized. In this paper, a Model-Driven Approach is presented to develop the automated testing scripts for the validation of the FinTech Web Applications. A Meta-Model is proposed that depicts the scenario of regression testing of a FinTech system.

These incorporate Big Data, Internet of Things and FinTechs, for example, blockchain. Blockchain is a kind of an appropriated database that is utilized to repeat, share, and synchronize information spread crosswise over various geological areas, for example, different destinations, nations, or associations. The primary property of blockchain is that there is no focal director or brought together information stockpiling system. Agreement calculations administer the peerto-peer decentralized system. Various advantages and uses of blockchains have brought about it getting well known among an expansive range of organizations, yet is it the case in the development business? Given, the regressive idea of the development business in digitalisation and its hesitance to transform it gets imperative to dissect the potential effect of Blockchains as a potential troublesome innovation. In spite of the fact that there exists a critical research hole and the potential probability to test blockchain in the development area, the development business is generally announced as the second most reduced part to have embraced data innovation. This prompts a problem whether blockchain is an unadulterated innovative promotion or whether there is a genuine potential application in development. The paper is focused on basically examining the application capability of blockchains in development through an utilization case examination and extensive writing survey to determine whether it is unadulterated promotion or genuine. The investigation uncovered that because of the exponential employments of blockchain, ventures included, and various new companies adding to Industry 4.0, blockchain in fact has a believable potential in the development business. © 2019 SERSC.",Article,2-s2.0-85080140653

Due to the wide adoption of IT, various FinTech applications are used by financial industry to help process information and offer financial services. Traditionally, textual passwords are the most widely deployed authentication mechanism, while having many known limitations. As a result, there is a need to enhance the security of FinTech authentication against cyber-criminals. As an alternative, graphical passwords (GPs) are considered as one promising solution to complement traditional password-based systems. In the literature, various GP schemes were proposed such as PassPoints, DAS, Cued Click Points, GeoPass, etc. In this work, we identify that multiple password inference has become a challenge for most GP schemes, and thus design RouteMap, a map-and route-based GP to further improve the security of FinTech applications. This scheme requires users to create a route on a world map as their credentials. In the evaluation, we involved a total of 120 participants, among which 60 of them have financial (FinTech) background, and investigated the performance of RouteMap by comparing it with two similar schemes. Our results demonstrate that participants can achieve better performance using RouteMap in the aspects of both authentication accuracy and multiple password memory.

The process is also tiresome for customers as they need to undergo the same process for each bank or financial institution with which they intend to work. Personal experiences of people dictate the cumbersome nature of the process, thereby demanding an efficacious alternative. Through this paper, we intend to do exactly that. We propose a new solution based on Distributed Ledger Technology or Blockchain technology, which will reduce the traditional KYC verification process cost for Institutions and cut short the general time line of the completion of the process while making it smoother for the customers. Major enhancement in our solution over the conventional methods is that the whole verification process is conducted only once for each customer, irrespective of number of institutions he or she wishes to be linked to. Also, since we are using the DLT, verification results can be securely shared with the customers thereby increasing transparency. Following this approach, we developed a Proof of Concept (POC) with the Ethereum API, websites as endpoints and an android app as front office; realising the feasibility and effectiveness of this approach. All in all, this approach improves customer experience, reduces cost overheads, and increases transparency in the process of onboarding a customer. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85083040894

This Study focuses on how employees should be ready for the Artificial Intelligence implementations in banks. As Sri Lankan banks are still in the foundational level this study will make them aware of the current situation of what employees thinks of AI and whether they are ready to accept the technology or whether they are insecure about their job due to the change. Study have collected information through secondary sources and primary sources through a questionnaire. People readiness comprises of three variables, which are AI mind set, Employee skills, and their current job role. Based on the different factors analyzed, it can be seen that employees are ready to adopt AI in Sri Lankan banks but there are some restrictions, the employees are comfortable with the changes but they are insecure about their job. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85084403765
"Sakho S., Jianbiao Z., Essaf F., Badiss K.",Improving Banking Transactions Using Blockchain Technology,2019.0,banking; blockchain; cloud microservices; transaction,"Today, the majority of banks offer many different online services to their customers and our study case will focus specifically on domestic and international banking transactions. By doing these services, these banks use enough time to conduct bank transactions from one bank account to another, some of which take more than a week, under a security that does not fully respect the privacy of operators and under the mercy of certain third party's services. Unfortunately, these banks face the limitations of payment systems (such as SWIFT, SEPA, and union pay) for international transactions and other banking exchange services. To remedy these problems of third-party trust, exaggerated latency, payment of high transaction fees, problems of theft and falsification of banking information, we will set up a storage and bank exchange platform, based on a private and confidential blockchain. In this platform, a number of authorized users will be able to hold and operate the nodes that will support the network. Nowhere in the world is there a system that directly connects banks, currencies and financial institutions without a trusted third party. In our case, these sworn users are banks. This platform will eliminate the presence of the trusted third party which is the third entity through which the various transactions and banking information must pass. To begin with, our platform will eliminate third-party trust, promote user-user transactions and then store bank transaction information in the blockchain. Our blockchain platform will allow users to make secure and confidential transactions at a lower cost and without a foreign exchange ban due to a maximum amount not to exceed as with the case of banks. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85084074997

As the population is increasing at a constant rate, it will also in turn lead to increase in the volume of the data which we refer it as big data. Nowadays, various organizations or industries (like banking, e-commerce, insurance, etc.) are working on analyzing this big data by dividing the raw data in several fractions so that these sectors can facilitate their customers by analyzing each fraction efficiently. Analysis of big data help these industries in various fields like, money movements, threats, disasters, etc. Nowadays, online banking is one of the general service which was provided to all the customer. As the e-Transactions are increasing due to online banking facilities risks of fraud is also increased, so big data analytics also helpful in determining the detection of fraud. Every banking industry generates crucial data from the customer which needs to be stored and analyzed effectively using big data analytic methods to get the necessary insights for banking organizations. Nowadays banking industry start working on analyzing big data to attain goals of marketing. Hence, use of BDA in India would help banks in generating the actions which would help in making the future decisions more effective and stay at peak in business and competition. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85083575446

Park D.-H.,Virtuality changes consumer preference: The effect of transaction virtuality as psychological distance on consumer purchase behavior,2019.0,Construal level theory; Digital money; FinTech; Psychological distance; Virtuality,"With the rapid development of information and communication technology, a variety of new industries and services are rapidly evolving based on the convergence between existing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and heterogeneous industries. In the meantime, the FinTech market, created by the convergence of financial and ICT areas, is emerging and growing rapidly. The new market of virtual transaction based on digital money is growing faster than any other FinTech area. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the perceived difference in the virtuality of a consumer's transaction affects the consumer's purchasing behavior and how the behavior changes. Specifically, this study revealed that consumers' perceived virtuality differs according to the type of transaction method. Consumers felt that the money was more virtual when they had digital (virtual) currency for a service than when they had cash. This virtuality of money controls the psychological distance of the consumer's money, which is closer to cash than virtual currency. This difference in psychological distance affects consumers' information processing, such that when psychological distances are far (vs. close), consumers prefer products that are described as abstract (vs. concrete), and have a more favorable attitude toward products with more variety. © 2019 by the author.",Article,2-s2.0-85076562941

We compare loans made by LendingClub and similar loans that were originated by banks. The correlations between the rating grades (assigned by LendingClub) and the borrowers’ FICO scores declined from about 80% (for loans originated in 2007) to about 35% for recent vintages (originated in 2014–2015), indicating that nontraditional data (not already accounted for in the FICO scores) have been increasingly used by fintech lenders. The rating grades perform well in predicting loan default. The use of alternative data has allowed some borrowers who would have been classified as subprime by traditional criteria to be slotted into “better” loan grades, allowing them to obtain lower priced credit. © 2019 Financial Management Association International",Article,2-s2.0-85074764134

"Nastiti N.D., Kasri R.A.",The role of banking regulation in the development of Islamic banking financing in Indonesia,2019.0,Bank stimulus; Banking regulation; Islamic banking and finance; Islamic banking in Indonesia; Islamic financial technology,"Purpose: The 2015 global economic crisis has triggered the issuance of several banking regulations in Indonesia, including those related to temporary stimulus for Islamic banks and branchless banking (fintech). However, few studies attempt to evaluate the effectiveness of such regulations. Thus, this study aims to determine the role and assess the effectiveness of such banking regulations. Design/methodology/approach: The data used cover all 12 Islamic commercial banks in Indonesia during the stimulus period of Q3.2015 to Q2.2017. The variables included were banks’ fundamental factors (Islamic financing, capital adequacy ratio, investment, non-performing financing, return on asset, efficiency, financing deposit ratio and fintech) and macroeconomic variables (inflation, exchange rate and money supply). The model was analyzed by using multiple linear regressions with generalized least square estimation technique. Findings: The main finding suggests that the stimulus regulation indeed played a positive role in the acceleration of Islamic bank financing. However, the fintech-related regulation was not yet effective to achieve the goal, at least in the short term. Furthermore, the study found that return of assets, operational efficiency, financing deposit ratio and money supply also influenced Islamic financing. Practical implications: For policymakers, the effectiveness of the temporary stimulus in accelerating Islamic banking financing and preventing the possible negative impacts of the external crisis provides indications that the regulator could conduct similar policy in the future. More generally, the findings are also expected to enrich Islamic banking literature. Originality/value: This is possibly one of the few studies to investigate the role and effectiveness of banking regulations on Islamic banking financing in Indonesia. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85074334098

With the emergence of FinTech, which, with respect to the banking sector, is merging high-tech with the k-economy, there is an emerging need to highlight the importance and understand the dynamics of bank IC. With respect to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies, where FinTech has become de rigueur, banking is bifurcated into Islamic and banking sectors. Through comparative empirical analysis, the purpose of this paper is to examine IC efficiency in Islamic and conventional banks with a view to elucidating the impact of IC, in aggregate and decomposed into its components, on an operational, financial and market performance of Islamic banks juxtaposed with conventional banks. Design/methodology/approach: Using data collected from 59 banks for five years (2012-2016) involving 295 observations, an independent variable derived from the modified value added IC (MVAIC) components are regressed against dependent bank performance indicator variables [Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Tobin’s Q (TQ)]. Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: bank-specific and macroeconomic. Findings: The findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is positive relationship between IC efficiency and financial performance (ROE) and market performance (TQ) in Islamic banks. In conventional banks, however, there is a positive relationship between IC and operational performance (ROE) and financial performance (ROE). Originality/value: The model in this paper presents a valuable analytical framework for exploring IC efficiency as a driver of performance in dual-sector banking economies characterized by co-existence of Islamic and conventional financial institutions. In addition, this paper highlights bank management lacunae manifesting in terms of the weak nexus between: IC and asset efficiency (ROA) in Islamic banks and IC and market value (TQ) in conventional banks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85074456769

In this study, based on the weighted least squares (WLS) and threshold regression methods of cross-sectional data, we empirically examine the impact of FinTech development on agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, a major cause of impaired surface water quality. Our results show that there is an inverted “U” shape relationship between the development of FinTech and agricultural NPS pollution. That is, after crossing a “threshold value”, the level of FinTech development can curb agricultural NPS pollution. At the structural level, the availability of FinTech services, the FinTech infrastructure, and the agricultural NPS pollution also have an inverted “U” shape relationship. At the threshold effect, in the developing stage of an agricultural economy, the overall level of FinTech development, the use of FinTech services, the availability of FinTech services, and the FinTech infrastructure have an inverted “U” shape relationship with agricultural NPS pollution. On the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the impact of FinTech development and its structure on agricultural NPS pollution is insignificant. Hence, we can conclude that FinTech development can help reduce agricultural NPS pollution in under-developed regions. However, due to the fact that a “U” shape relationship always exists between FinTech service quality and agricultural NPS pollution, the quality of FinTech service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural NPS pollution more effectively. © 2019 by the authors.

Managing strategic reorientation in new ventures,2019.0,Experimentation; Innovation; Organizational adaptation; Pivots; Product-development processes; Qualitative methods; Rhetorical strategy; Startups; Strategic reorientation; Technology entrepreneurship,"New ventures often experience deviations from their plans that oblige them to reorient in pursuit of a better fit between their evolving products and their target customers. Yet, research is largely silent on how managers explain such changes and justify their ventures in the wake of fundamental redirections in strategy. Ventures initially attain legitimacy and amass resources on the strength of aims that audiences find compelling; later, those early claims can complicate course corrections. To shed light on how ventures manage strategic reorientations, we conducted an inductive, comparative case study of ventures in a nascent financial-technology sector. The ventures pursued parallel reorientations and produced comparable end products but diverged conspicuously in managing audiences during transitions. Our process model, inspired by these differences, proposes a sequence of stratagems that may enable entrepreneurs to alter strategy while portraying faithfulness to enduring aims. Our theoretical framework posits that, for ventures, reorientation without penalty may depend on how they anticipate, justify, and stage changes to various audiences. © 2019 INFORMS.",Article,2-s2.0-85084798767

Kalra D.,Overriding FINTECH,2019.0,Blockchain; digital wallet; FinTech,"Finance technology have been coexisting during the evolution of modern society and this coexistence was mainly restricted to collection and payment of taxes in the form of coins and paper money, managing government finances, and agricultural production. The term FinTech emerged in 1972, as an acronym of Financial Technologies, is often described as amalgamation of financial services using technological evolutions, and its usage was earlier limited to banking sector deploying modern management Science and Computers (Bettinger, 1972, p.62). Fintech was mainly restricted to back-office processes of banks leveraging software and applications to manage customer accounts and their transactions in a secured, centralized, and efficient way. Micu (2016), referred Fintech as a new paradigm of technology to facilitate business, international trade, and services offered to retail consumers. Schueffel (2016) conceptualized FinTech as a technological encapsulation of Financial Sector rather than a technology. Smartphones with high speed Internet has triggered the growth of Fintech through customer facing apps. Takahashi (2018), predicted that global smartphone usage will surpass 3.8 billion by the end of year 2021, accounting for 48% of the global population.

While e-wallet has been used extensively in China, the state on whether the Chinese students from China will continuously use e-wallet in Malaysia is still unknown. This is particularly in terms of the determinants that could explain why mainland Chinese students in Malaysia would continuously use e-wallet. The technology acceptance model (TAM) was used to determine the relationship between perceived ease of use and usefulness with e-wallet users‟ continuance intention. Three additional variables suggested by the literature were integrated into the research model. These are enjoyment, trust and satisfaction. Hence, this study aims to examine the proposed relationship between perceived ease of use, usefulness, enjoyment, trust and satisfaction with the e-wallet users‟ continuance intention among the mainland Chinese students in Malaysia. The data was collected using the online survey. The data gathered from 388 respondents was then used to determine the relationship between the constructs. The results reveal significant relationships between ease of use and usefulness with the attitudes of continuance intention. The findings also found that the three additional variables of enjoyment, trust, and satisfaction influenced the attitude of mainland Chinese students towards e-wallet use; and that attitude significantly influenced the continuance intention to use e-wallet. Hence, the findings shed light in terms of identifying the factors that influence users‟ continuance intention to use e-wallet. The findings inform the e-wallet service provider with the importance information on how to secure customer retention and attract new users for e-wallet. © 2020 Mattingley Publishing.

This term covers a large range of techniques, from data security to financial service. Specially, user privacy protection is generally considered one of the most significant aspects in the financial security domain and preserving data carrying privacy is a critical task in producing a privacy protection strategy, e.g., one of the crucial issues in mobile finance is to ensure the legitimate mobile device users can efficiently search inclusive information from servers without leaking the user privacy. More precisely, more and more mobile finance APP(e.g., AliPay, China Unionpay Quick Pass) has the auxiliary tool or third-party services function that enable users make a location-based services(LBS) query, while the LBS usually carry users’ location privacy and that data of service providers should be accessed by legitimate users. In order to address this problem, in this paper, we propose a privacy-preserving LBS framework which supports the query area is a square area based on the user's location, and achieves fine-grained access control on the financial service provider data, user's privacy(especially location privacy), confidentiality of the service provider data, and accurate query result. More precisely, our framework also uses redundant point-of-interesting(POI) records to protect privacy against LBS provider(LBSP), but employs a semi-trusted third party(called proxy) to filter out redundant POI records. We propose a novel blind filter protocol based on comparable attribute-based encryption(CABE) and “transformation” technique, which can filter out the encrypted POI records under the condition that both LBSP and proxy without knowing the user's location information. In comparison with existing solutions, our framework not only realize access control on service provider data innately, but also incurs lower communication and computation overhead on the user side. The analysis and the experiments indicate that our framework is secure and efficient for mobile devices in terms of computation and the communication overhead. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85066411969

One of the most emerging technologies of the 21st century is blockchain. It is a revolution for the digital world as it brings a new perspective of security, efficiency, and productivity of different frameworks. It works as a distributed database that is shared among a decentralized network of computers. It stores information about the transaction that is made with cryptocurrency and is maintained with the help of different computers which are linked in a peer-to-peer network. No single user can control the transactions, but everyone can inspect it. The information about the transactions is assembled as a 'block' and these blocks are linked with each other as a 'chain'. That's why it is called blockchain. The information inside blocks is immutable. The technology of blockchain is so efficient that it is not only used in securing financial information but also in credit history, real estate, public transport, music streaming, healthcare and so forth. According to Don and Alex Tapscott (2016), blockchain records not just financial transactions but virtually everything valuable. Currently, there is a wide spectrum of blockchain applications. The purpose of the research paper is to discuss some of the utilization of blockchain and they are Cybersecurity, Internet of Things (IoT), Fintech, Cloud Storage, Media, Travel, and Education.

It is important to predict whether a borrower can repay because the lenders must bear the credit risk when the borrower defaults, but it is difficult to design feature extractors with very complex information about borrowers and loan products. In this paper, we present an architecture of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting the repayment in P2P social lending to extract features automatically and improve the performance. CNN is a deep learning model for classifying complex data, which extracts discriminative features automatically by convolution operation on lending data. We classify the borrower's loan status by capturing the robust features and learning the patterns. Experimental results with 5-fold cross-validation show that our method automatically extracts complex features and is effective in repayment prediction on Lending Club data. In comparison with other machine learning methods, the standard CNN has achieved the highest performance with 75.86%. Exploiting various CNN models such as Inception, ResNet, and Inception-ResNet results in the state-of-the-art performance of 77.78%. We also demonstrate that the features extracted by our model are better performed by projecting the samples into the feature space. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,2-s2.0-85075384852

Here we fill this gap by proposing an adapted Global Financial Network (GFN) framework for conceptualizing the organizational and geographic logic of the digital platform economy in finance, and applying it to examine the impact of the digital platform model on asset management. As we will show, asset management is being profoundly disrupted by what we dub digital asset management platforms—or DAMPs—which encompass services including index fund and ETF provision, robo-advising, and analytics and trading support. Like other digital platforms, DAMPs do not so much leverage technology to enhance their competitiveness within markets, as to radically restructure the market itself. Also, like other platforms, their rise has produced a winner-take-all paradox of centralization through democratization that defies predictions of technology-enabled industry decentralization. However, the logic and implications of the rise of DAMPs diverges, in other respects, from non-financial digital platforms, as finance has long possessed an informational intensity and regulatory and organizational fluidity characteristic of the digital platform economy. Consequently, the digital platform model has mostly developed endogenously in asset management through incremental innovation by major financial firms—in a process that has reinforced the position of leading incumbent asset management centers, and above all New York—rather than being introduced from the outside by upstart technology firms and clusters. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85071015171

At the same time, most African economies continue to be at the tail end of global financial innovations adoption. Given lagging consumer adoption of cryptocurrency in South Africa, the purpose of this paper is to apply the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to predict behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Design/methodology/approach: A survey instrument based on the TPB was used to collect quantitative data for predicting adoption from adult distance students at the Mancosa, Cape Town campus. For data analysis, the two-step structural equation modelling approach was used. Findings: The findings indicate that attitude and perceived behavioural control positively impact the intention to adopt cryptocurrency. Subjective norm showed a negative non-significant influence. Overall, the results of the study show that the model has a good model fit and can be used to explain the theory. Research limitations/implications: The results of this study may not be generalisable to the wider population as it is only based on a cross-sectional study of a sample of adult students at a single institute in South Africa. Originality/value: The contribution of this paper is threefold: it is one of a few studies on the behavioural intention to adopt cryptocurrency in South Africa using the TPB model, it contributes towards the use of predictive behavioural economics models in understanding consumer behaviour critical to accelerating the adoption of financial innovations, and the results of the study also inform behaviour change strategies that can be applied by practitioners or policymakers to improve adoption.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the value of utilizing a neural networks (NNs) approach using mergers and acquisition (M&A) data confined in the US technology domain. Design/methodology/approach: Using data from Bloomberg for the period 2000–2016, the results confirm that an NN approach provides more explanation between financial variables in the model than a traditional regression model where the NN approach of this study is then compared with linear classifier, logistic regression. The empirical results show that NN is a promising method of evaluating M&A takeover targets in terms of their predictive accuracy and adaptability. Findings: The findings emphasize the value alternative methodologies provide in high-technology industries in order to achieve the screening and explorative performance objectives, given the technological complexity, market uncertainty and the divergent skill sets required for breakthrough innovations in these sectors. Research limitations/implications: NN methods do not provide for a fuller analysis of significance for each of the autonomous variables in the model as traditional regression methods do. The generalization breadth of this study is limited within a specific sector (technology) in a specific country (USA) covering a specific period (2000–2016). Practical implications: Investors value firms before investing in them to identify their true stock price; yet, technology firms pose a great valuation challenge to investors and analysts alike as the latest information technology stock price bubbles, Silicon Valley and as the recent stratospheric rise of financial technology companies have also demonstrated. Social implications: Numerous studies have shown that M&As are more often than not destroy value rather than create it. More than 50 percent of all M&As lead to a decline in relative total shareholder return after one year. Hence, effective target identification must be built on the foundation of a credible strategy that identifies the most promising market segments for growth, assesses whether organic or acquisitive growth is the best way forward and defines the commercial and financial hurdles for potential deals. Originality/value: Technology firm value is directly dependent on growth, consequently most of the value will originate from future customers or products not from current assets that makes it challenging for investors to measure a firm’s beta (risk) where the value of a technology is only known after its commercialization to the market. A differentiated methodological approach used is the use of NNs, machine learning and data mining to predict bankruptcy or takeover targets. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85057594572

However, it can be cost-intensive or time-consuming to interpret big data from any research conducted in the field. In this paper, the researchers created a machine-learning model to help minimize those research barriers. This study analyzed Chinese luxury consumption behavior, while the Chinese contributed 33% of the global luxury market in 2018 and play as a growth engine in the luxury market (Bain & Company. 2019. https://www.bain.com/insights/whats-powering-chinas-market-for-luxury-goods/). The researchers interpreted this analysis using machine-learning algorithms through different sets of conditions and then proposed an understandable and highly accurate machine-learning model. Unlike traditional statistical methods, which rely on domain experts to create hand-crafted features, this paper proposes an unsupervised end-to-end model that can directly and accurately process questionnaire data without human intervention.

Currently a variety of forms of remittances is used. Most of them initially had a paper form, then with the development of technology they acquired an electronic form. The introduction of new financial technologies contributes to the transition to the digital form of their implementation. One of such financial technologies is the blockchain technology, which operates on the basis of protocols (rules) of accounting for operations with 'cryptocurrency'. The name 'cryptocurrency' or 'cryptographic currency' comes from the encryption technology 'cryptography', so this name can be considered as a technological one. For the development of approaches to legal regulation, the priority, according to the author, is to determine the essence of the definition of 'cryptocurrency', i.e. establishing its scope and content, indicating the distinctive features. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85084386399

A hash-based blockchain holds the feature of strong tamper resistance. However, it is almost impossible to change fraud transactions in time, since starting a fork requires a lot of time and resources. Failing to remove fraudulent transactions in time is harmful to the entire economic environment. In order to deal with the modification problem, in this work, we propose a novel polynomial-based blockchain structure. Data segments are organized by a Lagrange interpolation method in each block. Polynomial functions are used to keep the order of blocks. The polynomial-based blockchain structure not only achieves the aim of modification but also supports differential control strategy on modification difficulty. Experimental results demonstrate that the polynomial-based blockchain structure is efficient and practical. Detailed theoretical and practical analysis showed that the polynomial-based modifiable blockchain structure has a wide range of application scenarios with the help of other techniques on cryptography and privacy preservation. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85064594729

In traditional financial studies, economic models and statistic approaches were widely used for predicting exchange rates. Recently, machine learning and deep learning techniques have played increasingly important roles in financial technology studies. This study adopts a deep learning technique called relation networks (RNs) to predict the exchange rates of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To discover the relationship among different currencies, the concept of visual question answering (VQA) is applied in RNs. We also propose a specially designed architecture for the feature extraction stage to consider both spatial and temporal relationships simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve higher prediction performance for cryptocurrencies with approximately 65% accuracy rate.

Bernards N.,"Tracing mutations of neoliberal development governance: ‘Fintech’, failure and the politics of marketization",2019.0,development; financial inclusion; Fintech; markets; neoliberalism; poverty,"This article interrogates recent policy pronouncements around the promotion of emerging financial technologies (fintech) as means of enabling financial inclusion. It is argued that situating this emergent ‘turn to technology’ in the context of a longer-running pattern of failed efforts to promote the development of financial markets for the poor in the Global South offers us a useful lens on the dynamics of neoliberalism. The article develops this analysis by drawing together interlinked discussions of ‘neoliberal reason’, highlighting the central role played by the diffusion of market institutions in neoliberal projects with Marxian discussions highlighting the crucial underlying role of labour in enabling the operation of markets. In this context the appeal to ever-more fine-grained information with which to allocate credit underlying the turn to technology can both be read as yet another attempt to ‘re-engineer’ the market, and also seen as a doomed project. Empirically, this argument is fleshed out through an engagement with key framework documents around financial inclusion and technology from the World Bank and G20. © The Author(s) 2019.",Article,2-s2.0-85068900140

"Jain N., Agrawal T., Goyal P., Hassija V.",A Blockchain-Based distributed network for Secure Credit Scoring,2019.0,Blockchain; Credit Score; Digital Identity; Fintech; Privacy; Security,"Credit scoring is a method that is used by banks to estimate the risk of lending money to an individual. It determines the ability of that person to repay the debts. Higher the credit score, higher is the probability of getting the loan. Before approving the loan, in addition to calculating the credit score, banks also need to digitally verify the client's credentials. This is a very tedious task involving a lot of paperwork. It becomes even more cumbersome when the person is underprivileged i.e. from rural areas or does not hold any bank account. This paper presents a solution to the above problem by introducing a framework that will create a secure digital identity and store the past transactions made to calculate the credit score using blockchain. Blockchain is a digital ledger that is resistant to modifications. It creates a distributed network of users where details of each transaction are transparent, thereby enhancing the level of trust in the network. The aim of this paper is twofold: (1) providing fair and unbiased access to credit to people who are deprived of the basic financial amenities and (2) efficient digital verification. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85085499026

Wei D.,Prediction of Stock Price Based on LSTM Neural Network,2019.0,LSTM; neural network; prediction of stock price,"This study, based on the demand for stock price prediction and the practical problems it faces, compared and analyzed a variety of neural network prediction methods, and finally chose LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory, LSTM) neural network. Then, through in-depth study on how to predict the stock price by the LSTM neural network optimized by MBGD algorithm, the feasibility of the method and the applicability of the model are analyzed, and finally the conclusion is drawn. It is found that historical information is very important to investors as the basis of investment decisions. Past studies have used opening and closing prices as key new predicators of financial markets, but extreme maxima and minima may provide additional information about future price behavior. Therefore, the index of three representative stocks in China's stock market are selected as the research objects, and the key data collected from them include the opening price, closing price, lowest price, highest price, date and daily trading volume. The results show that although LSTM neural network model has some limitations, such as the time lag of prediction, but with attention layer, it can predict stock prices. Its main principle is to discover the role of time series through analyzing the historical information of the stock market, and to deeply explore its internal rules through the selective memory advanced deep learning function of LSTM neural network model, so as to achieve the prediction of stock price trend. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85084731465

To analyze the role of fintech in the national economy, we first broaden its definition and compare its economic performance using three methodologies-Demand-driven model, Supply-driven model and industry linkage effect in interindustry analysis. We find that the fintech industry has a stronger effect on production inducement. Regarding industry linkage effects, fintech ranked the top in all 31 industries for the forward linkage effect and 22 for the background linkage effect-much higher than the traditional financial industry. This implies that the fintech industry is effective as the intermediate good with national demand as well as the final good. Particularly, this industry plays the roles of intermediate and final goods across almost all industries. That is, fintech could better promote overall national economic performance as a platform industry. Because most businesses within the fintech industry depend on innovation through the integration of finance and information technology, we find that fintech can feasibly prompt the fourth industrial revolution. Nonetheless, this industry is characterized by excessive regulations in Korea, indicating the need for negative regulation for new, innovative businesses within the fintech industry that would critically emphasize innovativeness for inclusive, sustainable economic growth. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,2-s2.0-85073426463

Although an increasing number of studies have demonstrated the potential of SCF resulting in improving cash-flow management and obtaining loan opportunities for suppliers and buyers, little is known about whether SCF initiatives can result in positive market value for service providers. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to examine the effect of SCF initiatives with the distinctive characteristics (that is, firm characteristic, collaborative mechanism, and service type)on service providers’ market value. We adopted the event study methodology to analyse 177 SCF initiatives announced between 2008 and 2018 (Quarter 1)in the Chinese market. The event study results showed that the average abnormal returns over a three-day event window around the SCF announcements are 0.793%, representing an average increase of CNY 1.66 billion in market value for the service providers. Moreover, we found that such increase in market value is significantly higher when the SCF initiatives are announced by non-bank investors (e.g., fintechs), when the service providers collaborate to provide SCF services, and when the service providers upgrade existing SCF services rather than introduce new SCF services. As the market value of an SCF announcement is evaluated with several essential characteristics examined to understand which types of service providers and initiatives are considered to be the most valuable service offerings, this study offers important insights to SCF practitioners and supply chain stakeholders. © 2019",Article,2-s2.0-85065840830

Evidence from YuEbao,2019.0,Continuance intention; FinTech; Herding; Structural assurance; Subjective norm; Trust,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of trust in service and structural assurance on the continuance intention of FinTech services, and the roles of technical factors (i.e. situational normality and system quality) and social factors (i.e. herding and subjective norm) in developing trust in service and structural assurance. YuEbao is selected as the subject as it is a representative example of FinTech services in China. Design/methodology/approach: A survey questionnaire was deployed and a ten-point sliding scale with two-decimal points was applied to improve the accuracy of the questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling was used to analyze the data. Findings: Trust in service and structural assurance can encourage continuance intention of FinTech service. System quality, situational normality and subjective norm can boost the development of trust in service. Both herding and subjective norm can affect structural assurance significantly. Research limitations/implications: The study highlights the important roles played by technical factors (i.e. situational normality and system quality) and social factors (i.e. herding and subjective norm) in developing the two levels of trust (i.e. trust in service and structural assurance). It also validates the influences of trust in service and structural assurance on encouraging customers’ continuance intention in the novel context of FinTech. Practical implications: The findings of this study can be used by practitioners to encourage customers to continue using their FinTech services. To encourage continuance, service providers can improve the quality of their system, design the system to be aligned with customers’ using habits and show customers that their close friends are also using the service. Originality/value: This study adds to the existing body of trust literature by investigating the direct effects of trust in service and structure assurance on continuance intention and how these two levels of trust are developed from technical and social aspects. It generates interesting insights into customers’ continuance behavior of FinTech services. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85074186687
"Bernards N., Campbell-Verduyn M.",Understanding technological change in global finance through infrastructures: Introduction to Review of International Political Economy Special Issue ‘The Changing Technological Infrastructures of Global Finance’,2019.0,Finance; financial inclusion; financialization; governance; infrastructure; innovation; technology,"Amid escalating claims about the promises and perils of emergent financial technologies (fintech), critical investigation of the extent to which specific technological changes in global finance are truly ‘disruptive’ is sorely needed. Yet, IPE has engaged little with the growing focus on fintech in popular and regulatory debates, as well as in Social Studies of Finance (SSF). This article and accompanying special issue foreground ‘infrastructures’ as a heuristic for injecting nuance into debates on the emergence, limits and implications of technological changes in global finance while bringing IPE into conversation with perspectives on fintech in cognate literatures. Building on insights developed in Science and Technology Studies (STS), we argue that tracing the ways in which infrastructures enabling financial markets to operate are assembled out of multiple old and new socio-technical devices offers productive avenues for addressing key questions arising from several entanglements underpinning technological change. The findings of contributions to this special issue are linked to two key themes in debates on the impacts of technological change: financial inclusion and financial stability. Further avenues are proposed for examining the infrastructures in which technological change occurs in global finance and beyond, while fostering on-going dialogues between IPE, STS and SSF. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

Bernards N.,"The poverty of fintech? Psychometrics, credit infrastructures, and the limits of financialization",2019.0,credit scoring; Financial inclusion; financialization; historical materialism; psychometrics; science and technology studies; technology,"It is increasingly common to claim that innovative financial technologies (‘fintech’) will enable ever-wider access to credit. Previous critical accounts have often linked the development of fintech to processes of financialization. However, these arguments rarely take account of the uneven and highly limited character of ‘financial inclusion’ in practice. Drawing on engagements with science and technology studies and historical materialist political economy, this article advances an approach emphasizing processes of abstraction from productive activities, mediated through particular infrastructures, as core elements of financial accumulation. Seen in this light, psychometrics in particular and alternative credit data more broadly can be seen as flawed efforts to confront three sets of limits—(1) the necessarily reductive character of abstract framings, and the consequent challenges posed by their encounter with complex processes in practice, (2) the ways that systems for credit scoring interact with the infrastructures of existing financial systems, and (3) the difficulty of realizing financial profits in the context of widespread precarious livelihoods. Looking at alternative forms of credit data from this angle offers a way of grasping the truncated and uneven rollout of fintech, and hence of prompting more critical reflections about the limits to processes of financialization. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85066820476

In the long list of FinTechs, one of the most attractive platforms is the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending which aims to bring the investors and borrowers hand in hand, leaving out the traditional intermediaries like banks. The main purpose of a financial institution as an intermediary is of controlling risk and P2P lending platforms innovate and use new ways of risk assessment. In the era of Big Data, using a diverse source of information from spending behaviors of customers, social media behavior, and geographic information along with traditional methods for credit scoring prove to have new insights for the proper and more accurate credit scoring. In this study, we investigate the machine learning techniques on big data platforms, analyzing the credit scoring methods. It has been concluded that on a HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System) environment, Logistic Regression performs better than Decision Tree and Random Forest for credit scoring and classification considering performance metrics such as accuracy, precision and recall, and the overall run time of algorithms. Logistic Regression also performs better in time in a single node HDFS configuration compared to a non-HDFS configuration. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85076215629

They are based on a combination of the capabilities of existing social networks and distributed ledger technology (DLT), as new subjects of competition in the banking sector of the market. The threat to commercial banks is determined by the risk of loss of income, in particular, commission income from transfer transactions that are already being executed in the social media environment, and which have the potential for growth in turnover. Despite the active development of crypto-innovations (algorithms, platforms, actually cryptocurrencies), the use of distributed ledger technologies by the banks themselves in the financial sector is still very modest. At the same time, social networks with a huge client base show an obvious interest in fintech prospects. These two components of the projects under discussion are contradictory and the success of integration is not obvious. Therefore, it is of interest to researchers in the financial sector.

Each acceptance criterion is typically expressed as a natural-language statement with a clear pass or fail outcome. Writing AC is a tedious and error-prone activity, especially when the requirements specifications evolve and there are different analysts and testing teams involved. Analysts and testers must iterate multiple times to ensure that AC are understandable and feasible, and accurately address the most important requirements and workflows of the system being developed. In many cases, analysts express requirements through models, along with natural language, typically in some variant of the UML. AC must then be derived by developers and testers from such models. In this paper, we bridge the gap between requirements models and AC by providing a UML-based modeling methodology and an automated solution to generate AC. We target AC in the form of Behavioral Specifications in the context of Behavioral-Driven Development (BDD), a widely used agile practice in many application domains. More specially we target the well-known Gherkin language to express AC, which then can be used to generate executable test cases. We evaluate our modeling methodology and AC generation solution through an industrial case study in the financial domain. Our results suggest that (1) our methodology is feasible to apply in practice, and (2) the additional modeling effort required by our methodology is outweighed by the benefits the methodology brings in terms of automated and systematic AC generation and improved model precision. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85076097932

It also predicts that personal and sociodemographic variables (familiarity with robots, age, gender and country) moderate the main relationships. Design/methodology/approach: Data from a web survey of 765 North American, British and Portuguese potential users of robo-advisor services confirm the validity of the measurement scales and provide the input for structural equation modeling and multisample analyses of the hypotheses. Findings: Consumers’ attitudes toward robo-advisors, together with mass media and interpersonal subjective norms, are found to be the key determinants of adoption. The influences of perceived usefulness and attitude are slightly higher for users with a higher level of familiarity with robots; in turn, subjective norms are significantly more relevant for users with a lower familiarity and for customers from Anglo-Saxon countries. Practical implications: Banks and other firms in the finance industry should design robo-advisors to be used by a wide spectrum of consumers. Marketing tactics applied should consider the customer’s level of familiarity with robots.

Siciliani P.,The disruption of the prudential regulatory framework,2019.0,Fintech credit; Prudential regulation; Regtech; Suptech,"This article first explores how the prudential regulatory framework may be drastically changed as a result of the adoption of regtech and suptech innovations. The adoption of a shared data architecture, whereby the regulator is provided with seamless access to the accounts of regulated firms, may result in the development of a centralized approach to regulatory modelling, thus bypassing the existing partition between internal models and standardized approaches. Secondly, this article discusses how, thanks to the adoption of advanced predictive analytics, non-bank fintech lenders can gain insights into borrowers' creditworthiness irrespective of banks' control over traditional sources of information for credit scoring. This, though, may give rise to a new type of strategic gaming, this time by borrowers keen to maximize their chances of being granted a loan. In any case, preventing banks from adopting these new methods for the purpose of regulatory modelling might weaken their competitiveness. Thirdly, this article explores whether the transition to a centralized approach for credit risk management would conflate the distinction between microprudential and macroprudential interventions, in particular with respect to the countercyclical macroprudential policy. Finally, the article argues that non-bank (fintech) firms could be persuaded to coalesce behind endorsement of the new regulatory shared data platform in return for the support from the central bank. In this way, the regulatory perimeter could be extended in order to steer the adoption of financial innovations in a manner that benefits society overall. © The Author(s) 2019.

The trades of U.S. Treasury Bonds have a huge influence on global economy. To analysis the trend of global economy, many economists believe U.S. Treasury Yield has the ability to predict the fluence of other financial markets such as stock market, futures market, Option market, etc. However, However, most financial prediction models focus only on predicting stock price, which is a sort of multidimensional time-series prediction. Although U.S. Treasury Yield could be viewed as a multidimensional time-series, the prediction models for predicting stock price are not able to completely satisfy the requirements for predicting U.S. Treasury Yield. Besides, most traditional machine learning methods focus only on estimation of short-term cash flow. As the result, the loss of traditional machine learning methods would significantly be increased while the period of prediction target is fluctuated. In this paper, we propose a Deep-Learning framework, DeepBonds, to build a prediction model to predict U.S. Treasury Yield with different issue period. Meanwhile, the Recurrent Neural Network with Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) architecture is utilized for effectively summarizing U.S. Treasury Yield as characteristic vectors. Based on the produced characteristic vectors, we can precisely predict future U.S. Treasury Yield with different issue period. We conduct a comprehensive experimental study based on a real dataset collected from the website of Resource Center of U.S. Department of The Treasury.

The fast development of fintech startups on creating payment gateway and peer-to-peer (P2P) lending applications is one of examples for the modern disruptive innovations affecting to traditional financial business. The problem arises when the digital disruption affects the bank's business models due to change in customer trends with additional impacts to conventional companies. This paper presents the quantitative approaches like statistical hypothesis testing and analysis of regression using convenient random sampling for better analyzing the impacts of fintech on conventional banking industry in Indonesia. A number of important and realistic variables, such as customer satisfaction, net promotion score, promotion, ease of use, etc., were considered in this research in order to find a variety of the value propositions that dominantly influence to the adoption of fintech or banking products. The results show that the banks have been disrupted by the payment fintech since the emergence of fintech companies in around 2015, mainly due to superior value propositions, like promotion with standardized beta value of 0.349 and wide range of merchants with 0.153, respectively. In addition, the fintech startups have digital strategies on adopting a customer-centric mindset and developing a product that gives their customer a high customer satisfaction. However, in the current time, P2P fintechs do not have that significant disruption to the banks, mainly due to the fact that the customers consider more on safety reasons. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85073251941

This is because the novel innovations of cryptocurrencies operate beyond the realm of the banking system, which may impact the performance of banks and their deposits variability. This study aims to investigate the long- and short-run effects of cryptocurrencies’ market capitalization development on the banks’ deposit variability in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Design/methodology/approach: In this study, the Johansen–Juselius (1990) cointegration test with vector error correction model was applied to examine the long-run relationships, while the Engle and Granger (1987) and the Granger (1969) causality tests were used to detect causal relationships in the short term. Findings: The findings of Johansen–Juselius cointegration test indicate that the banks’ deposits variability in all six states of the Gulf region share negative long-run equilibrium association with the development of global cryptocurrencies market capitalization, but with different statistically significant levels. For the short-run analysis, the study found that the development of cryptocurrencies market capitalization has significant unidirectional causal effects on bank deposits variabilities in only four states, namely, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. The findings of the study therefore suggest that to eradicate the effects of cryptocurrencies industry and its threats to the banking industry, banks in GCC region are encouraged to either consider cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment asset for their portfolio investment diversification strategies or adopt the blockchain technology in their operation system to facilitate their customers with low transaction cost, high level of security and ease of use and real-time settlement. Research limitations/implications: The empirical findings of the study will provide valuable input for policymakers, especially central banks and bank managements, to evaluate the current situation and the threats of the cryptocurrencies market growth and its effect on the banking industry’s performance, future survival and their deposits variability for better regulation and policy planning and investment strategies. Originality/value: This is a pioneering study that empirically explores the phenomenon of bank deposits variability as a consequence of expansion in cryptocurrencies market capitalization, where the findings proved evidence of a drastic decline in banks’ deposits size due to the substantial growth in cryptocurrencies market capitalization. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85071112061

Design/methodology/approach: A pre-tested survey instrument was used with a sample of 595 mobile money services users in Ghana. SmartPLS application was used to analyze the data and report findings. Findings: The study shows that perceived risk, consumer empowerment, subjective norm, performance expectancy and effort expectancy influence the affect component of consumer engagement and explain around half of its variance. The effect of perceived risk on consumer engagement was counterintuitive. Perceived risk was significant and positive for cognitive processing, whereas the effect was significant but negative for affect. The authors found support for the positive effect of cognitive processing on advocacy intention but no support for its effect on continuous usage. By contrast, affect strongly influenced both advocacy intention and continuous usage of mobile money services. Practical implications: The authors highlight the implications of mobile money services to business and marketing/service managers, policy makers, non-banking entities (such as telecoms and financial technology firms) and to the society in general. The authors provide important insights into how service providers can manage consumer engagement process and formulate marketing strategies to target and promote this simple, but innovative service to consumers. Moreover, the authors discuss the societal implications of the study in Ghana, a developing country. The authors recommend several options for future studies in order to stimulate the research agenda on mobile financial services in general. Originality/value: The present study shows that although mobile money was initially introduced to help consumers who hitherto have no access to formal banking services, this form of banking has become increasingly popular among various consumer segments as its usage and adoption has increased multifold largely in emerging and developing countries. The main contribution of this study is the development and testing of the “mobile money customer engagement model.” Moreover, this study shows the key factors that influence the engagement process and the effects of these factors as analyzed within the context of a developing country. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85078041918

Therefore, an offline questionnaire on consumer finance has been conducted in some cities of Jiangsu and Zhejiang in China, and 1491 questionnaires were obtained. And then, regression analyses were made between the education level of the respondents and various factors affecting the demand for consumer finance. The results show that it is different for the consumers with different educational background to select the wills and reasons of consumption credit, the field of credit products and consumer finance company, the mode of payment, the application of biometric technology in the security of consumption payment and etc. Generally speaking, the higher the level of education, the more the willing to accept consumption loans when purchasing goods or services, and the more the areas of consumption loans involved, but the more concentrated consumer finance companies are selected, the more payment modes are accepted when consumers pay, and the relatively easier the acceptance of the relatively complex security technologies such as biometric technology is. Thus, the providers of consumer finance products may improve their market shares by designing consumer finance products that conform to consumers' taste with different education background in the sales area of the product based on the big data of the Internet of things.

Due to their nature, FinTech products can be used within the dedicated regulatory framework or into the deep layers of the Internet. This feature of FinTech alone could potentially undermine the existing financial services regulation (FSR), the aim of which is to ensure financial stability through investor protection measures and measures protecting the integrity of the financial market. To this end, much of the illegal activities on the Dark Web have an interconnected and cross-sectorial impact on the FSR’s aims—for example, the on-going problem with stealing of personal data has implications on investor protection, often via market manipulation channels. Such considerations make it relevant to analyse the ways FinTech used on the Dark Web could affect traditional and FinTech activities in the financial sector. How strong this impact could be would probably depend on how ubiquitous FinTech innovations are on the Deep or Dark Web. This article will argue that by definition their market presence is not only across the entire Internet, but also very high in volume.

We look forward to providing proper candidates and encouraging sharing economy in finance sector which greatly decrease the cost of currency exchange. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85080944739
"Ngo N.D.K., Huynh V.N.",A method for innovation capability evaluation in banking,2019.0,Banking; Evaluation; Innovation; Innovation capability; Innovation management,"Measuring innovation processes becomes urgent in the era of fierce competition under the strong impact of technology development. That helps firms review their innovation activities, thereby to have reasonable adjustments in their innovation policies. There have been emerging innovation trends in banking industry such as using big data, mobile applications and cooperating with FinTech companies. However, there remain few relevant research on evaluating innovation capabilities in banking sector particularly. In this paper, first we determine key innovation management practices based on literature review and establish a set of measurement items for these practices. Then, an innovation capability evaluation method is developed based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP). A group of five experts in banking major is invited assess the development degree of each practice in a sample group of Vietnam banks as well as determine the importance weights for each practice. Finally, a composite innovation capability index is computed for each bank and used for ranking. The findings could be a basis for bank managers to propose new strategies in order to improve their innovation outcomes. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85074885831
"Liang J., Li L., Chen W., Zeng D.","Towards an understanding of cryptocurrency: A comparative analysis of cryptocurrency, foreign exchange, and stock",2019.0,Asset tree; Blockchain; Correlation matrix; Cryptocurrency; Financial market; Systemic risk,"Cryptocurrency is a cutting-edge Fintech innovation and currently a worldwide hotspot. However, the high-speed evolution of it has already caused a series of public security related events all around the world. Cryptocurrency was built initially as a possible implementation of digital currency, then various derivatives were created in a variety of fields such as financial transactions, capital management, and even nonmonetary applications. This paper aims to offer analytical insights to help understand cryptocurrency by treating it as a financial asset. We position cryptocurrency by comparing its dynamic characteristics with two traditional and massively adopted financial assets: foreign exchange and stock. Based on the daily close prices about four years, we first construct the correlation matrices and asset trees of all three markets, then conduct comparisons on five properties: volatility, centrality, clustering structure, robustness, and risk. Our investigation suggests that the dynamics of cryptocurrency are more similar to stock. As to the robustness and clustering structure, our analysis shows cryptocurrency market is more fragile than stock market, thus it is currently a high-risk financial market. Our work is the first to study cryptocurrency with the help of well-understood financial assets and may shed some light on investment decisions, regulation, and legislation. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85072969911

The main property that contract signing protocols must achieve is fairness of the exchange. The solutions presented to date are divided into two major types: those that have a trusted third party (TTP) to achieve fairness and those that do not. In the literature, we find more than 40 published proposals, but none of these proposed protocols has become a recognized or de facto standard in the market. Blockchain has provided a new way to address classic problems such as double spending, as well as problems such as fairness. In this article, we present a protocol for contract signing based on blockchain. Our proposed protocol does not require a conventional TTP, and it does not present the disadvantages of solutions without a TTP (computational and/or communication cost). The protocol satisfies the necessary security requirements: fairness, timeliness and non-repudiation. We demonstrate the feasibility of the protocol with a cost analysis and a proof of concept implementation. In addition, we show how Ethereum can be integrated in our solution as an alternative platform to the use of Bitcoin. Finally, we show how our proposal improves previous solutions for contract signing based on blockchain in terms of cost, efficiency and security. © 2019 The Authors",Article,2-s2.0-85067912042
Chen K.,Information asymmetry in initial coin offerings (ICOs): Investigating the effects of multiple channel signals,2019.0,Entrepreneurial finance; Fintech; Information asymmetry; Initial coin offering; Signal processing,"An initial coin offering (ICO) provides a new entrepreneurial finance approach for highly innovative blockchain ventures. However, the information asymmetry and adverse selection is severe in the ICO market. In this study, we focus on signals released in multiple channels in different ICO stages to investigate the relations between signal processing and information asymmetry. Referring to the multiple-channel communication theory, we characterize signal sources by their information schema, source credibility, and communication direction. Empirical results indicate that in the crowd sale stage, high credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant influences on token sales. In the listing stage, low credible and easy-interpretable signals have significant effects on token trading. High credible and hard-interpretable signals, which deliver project fundamental information, lose their functions in both stages, causing information asymmetry in ICOs. We also find that investor comments on social media, which is a multiple-way communication channel, play the role of information surveillance for ventures’ voluntary disclosures. Those findings provide insights for signal processing and asset pricing in the ICO market to reduce information asymmetry and have significant practical implications. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85065863099

In order to discover the factors that influenced the propensity to apply for FinTech loans, a theoretical model was designed, which was tested by means of a survey given to individuals who might contract loans. Design/methodology/approach: The final sample consisted of 507 individuals whose data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM), with estimation of partial least squares. Findings: From the results of the research, it was possible to draw a profile of the FinTechs of Brazilian loans and also to estimate the antecedents of the propensity to utilize this type of service. Research limitations/implications: The model proposed in this work was developed to measure the propensity to consume in relation to the credit services offered by lending FinTechs. Practical implications: The consumer should intensify the use of these channels to shape financial products and services to their needs, thereby democratizing access to credit, which is often restricted in quantity and quality by policies of institutions that dominate the Brazilian lending market. Originality/value: Aspects such as trust, personal innovation, perceived utility, ease of use and social influence, as well as the constructs that precede them like privacy, stigma and transactional distance, explain 41.5 percent of the propensity to use services from lending FinTechs in Brazil. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85062618101

Such responses and strategies are crucial for deterring future attacks, particularly in the financial and critical infrastructure sectors. However, existing approaches generally rely on manual analysis of attack indicators obtained through approaches such as trace-back, firewalls, intrusion detection and honeypot deployments. These attack indicators, also known as low-level Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), are rarely re-used and can be easily modified and disguised resulting in a deceptive and biased cyber threat attribution. Cyber attackers, particularly financially-motivated actors, can use common high-level attack patterns that evolve less frequently as compared to the low-level IOCs. To attribute cyber threats effectively, it is necessary to identify them based on the high-level adversary's attack patterns (e.g. tactics, techniques and procedures - TTPs, software tools and malware) employed in different phases of the cyber kill chain. Identification of high-level attack patterns is time-consuming, requiring forensic investigation of the victim network(s) and other resources. In the rare case that attack patterns are reported in cyber threat intelligence (CTI) reports, the format is textual and unstructured typically taking the form of lengthy incident reports prepared for human consumption (e.g. prepared for C-level and senior management executives), which cannot be directly interpreted by machines. Thus, in this paper we propose a framework to automate cyber threat attribution. Specifically, we profile cyber threat actors (CTAs) based on their attack patterns extracted from CTI reports, using the distributional semantics technique of Natural Language Processing. Using these profiles, we train and test five machine learning classifiers on 327 CTI reports collected from publicly available incident reports that cover events from May 2012 to February 2018. It is observed that the CTA profiles obtained attribute cyber threats with a high precision (i.e. 83% as compared to other publicly available CTA profiles, where the precision is 33%). The Deep Learning Neural Network (DLNN) based classifier also attributes cyber threats with a higher accuracy (i.e. 94% as compared to other classifiers). © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85061651762
"Chen K., Teng Q., Zhang Y.",Exploring the curriculum development of financial technology based on industry-academia collaboration,2019.0,Curriculum Development; FinTech; Industry-Academia Collaboration,"A trend of integrating Information Technology (IT) into the traditional financial industry has been increasing, impetus unavoidable due to the rapid development in IT. Traditional curricula of Finance had been built upon the framework of classic Economics, and this model started falling short providing qualified graduates to the financial workforce as the landscape changed. Financial Technology (FinTech) was the response, a newborn approach designed to address the gap. The curricula of conventional financial subjects lacked the practicality for studies, and the link between teaching and assessment needed revisiting. FinTech addresses the practicality and the link through carefully considering the transferability of applicable skills taught in education, Industry-Academia Collaboration, simply meaning to prepare students with practical skills that align with needs from the industry. This paper proposes a new curriculum model of FinTech based on the integration of teaching and talent needs from the finance industry. Practice is infused into the model, to which the step of corporation assessment of practice is introduced. This curriculum covers three parts, which are: 1) curriculum framework, 2) creativity of curriculum structure, and 3) assessment of practice.

The growth of mobile payments services; agent banking; the increase in the use of crowdfunding mechanisms to raise finance; and the growing interest in the use of cryptocurrencies by Africans to transact have all contributed to this trend. A common factor running through these recent developments is their ability to facilitate financial inclusion. Another characteristic they all share is that they all have cross-border dimensions. This therefore requires a coordinated approach to regulation, of which a regional regulatory approach is likely to play a prominent role.

However, a common issue is that they often have difficulty in communicating their enterprises’ value despite best efforts and practice to “signal” for mainstream finance. Subsequently, alternative financing mechanisms have been becoming more popular and successful globally. This is mainly because technological gains have been prompting increased regulatory measures, such as contained in the US JOBS Act 2012 and the UK FCA 2014/13 crowd funding and promotion of non-readily realisable securities and the establishment of the South African reserve bank’s fintech unit. Recently, following a call for proposals, the gauteng provincial government has sought to spearhead the establishment of an alternative financing platform, the Township Stock Exchange (TSE), for entrepreneurs, small businesses and emerging township enterprises in the Gauteng province of South Africa. To demystify the existing challenge this research study set out to develop an information exchange market for potential investment professionals to access township enterprise information and local economy business owners to signal for research on their companies by operating or simulating a Township Venture Research (TVR) online platform using small business information. Information Economics theory delves into the importance of information in the effective and efficient functioning of markets with key topics, such as adverse selection pioneered, signalling and screening by. Entrepreneurs and small enterprises often have to compete for a limited pool of finance and lack of a track record disenfranchises their opportunity to development finance. Better signalling and screening of local economy businesses would facilitate effective and fluid alternative markets that would have increased impact on meaningful growth and development in South Africa. © 2019, Allied Business Academies.

Thompson R.,“Underground banking” and Myanmar’s changing hundi system,2019.0,AML/CFT; Burma; Hundi; Informal value transfer system; Money laundering and terrorist financing; Myanmar,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to examine Myanmar’s “hundi” system, an informal value transfer system used widely by local Myanmar citizens and offshore migrant workers to remit money domestically and internationally. Due to historically stringent banking and foreign exchange controls and a lack of domestic and internationally linked financial services, the system grew to become the dominant medium for remittances in Myanmar. It also remains unregulated despite authorities acknowledging its use in criminal and terrorist activity. However, with an expanding and modernising financial sector, there is now increasing competition and challenges facing Myanmar’s hundi system. Design/methodology/approach: This paper draws on available literature and open source reporting, as well as interviews with former Myanmar Police Force officials. Findings: This study provides a unique insight into Myanmar’s hundi system, its history and the challenges it faces. The once dominant system remains a known anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) risk and is having to compete with an expanding and modernising formal banking sector and the introduction of fintech and mobile money services. In the short term, these are unlikely to eliminate the hundi system completely, but may instead push hundi operators towards adopting these networks and technologies in their own operations. Originality/value: Myanmar remains a very under-researched area and there has been a limited focus on its informal hundi remittance system and related AML/CFT issues. This paper will be a useful source for academics, development professionals, policymakers, law enforcement agencies and private sector actors seeking to understand Myanmar’s informal remittance system. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85068574549

Through analysis of 113 unique IFTTT ‘recipes’ shared by Monzo users on public community forums, we illustrate the potentially diverse functions of these recipes, and how they are achieved through different kinds of automation. Beyond achieving more convenient and efficient financial management, we note many playful and expressive applications of conditionality and automation that far extend traditional functions of banking applications and infrastructure. We use these findings to map opportunities, challenges and areas of future research in the development of ‘programmable money’ and related financial technologies. Specifically, we present design implications for the extension of native digital banking applications; novel uses of banking data; the applicability of blockchains and smart contracts; and future forms of financial autonomy. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85067602316

However, the modeling without rejected applicants and the imbalanced distribution of accepted examples affect the predictive performance. In this paper, we propose a novel framework for credit scoring using an imbalanced-learning-based reject inference. First, we employ an imbalanced learning for the accepted applicant data using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique for reject inference. Second, we conduct reject inference for rejected applicants based on a graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithm, which is called label propagation. Third, we use tree-based ensemble learning models as base classifiers to train the combined training data. Finally, we give an exact experiment for assessment using data from a Chinese auto loan company. The results indicate that the proposed novel framework performs better than comparative models, which represents a progressive method for auto loan. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85069430106

In worldwide, a fingerprint authentication system is scheduled to be installed in 2021, and mobile device shipments are expected to exceed 1 billion units. Biometric authentication maintains a high level of security while enabling instantaneous authentication without users having to physically carry something (e.g., a key) or memorize a password. It is being utilized in a variety of fields (smartphones, FinTech, etc.) due to this ease of use. The security aspects of biometric authentication are also being upgraded in terms of hardware as various companies make efforts in this direction. However, biometrics authentication is not sufficient from the viewpoint of the user side. Since biometric authentication uses advanced personal information as a key, there is a serious problem in that the key can't be reset if it leaks out. In this paper, on the basis of the user side viewpoint, we propose a secure operation model for biometric authentication that features cooperation between an Identity Provider (IDP) and hashing of biological information.

By using these so-called Open Banking APIs, third-party companies, such as FinTechs, are able to read information about and initiate payments from their users' bank accounts. Such access to financial data and resources needs to meet particularly high security requirements to protect customers. One of the most promising standards in this segment is the OpenID Financial-grade API (FAPI), currently under development in an open process by the OpenID Foundation and backed by large industry partners. The FAPI is a profile of OAuth 2.0 designed for high-risk scenarios and aiming to be secure against very strong attackers. To achieve this level of security, the FAPI employs a range of mechanisms that have been developed to harden OAuth 2.0, such as Code and Token Binding (including mTLS and OAUTB), JWS Client Assertions, and Proof Key for Code Exchange. In this paper, we perform a rigorous, systematic formal analysis of the security of the FAPI, based on an existing comprehensive model of the web infrastructure - the Web Infrastructure Model (WIM) proposed by Fett, Küsters, and Schmitz. To this end, we first develop a precise model of the FAPI in the WIM, including different profiles for read-only and read-write access, different flows, different types of clients, and different combinations of security features, capturing the complex interactions in a web-based environment. We then use our model of the FAPI to precisely define central security properties. In an attempt to prove these properties, we uncover partly severe attacks, breaking authentication, authorization, and session integrity properties. We develop mitigations against these attacks and finally are able to formally prove the security of a fixed version of the FAPI. Although financial applications are high-stakes environments, this work is the first to formally analyze and, importantly, verify an Open Banking security profile. By itself, this analysis is an important contribution to the development of the FAPI since it helps to define exact security properties and attacker models, and to avoid severe security risks before the first implementations of the standard go live. Of independent interest, we also uncover weaknesses in the aforementioned security mechanisms for hardening OAuth 2.0. We illustrate that these mechanisms do not necessarily achieve the security properties they have been designed for. © 2019 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85072934088
Gonzalez L.,"Blockchain, herding and trust in peer-to-peer lending",2019.0,Blockchain; Experimental behavioural finance; Financial inclusion; Financial trauma; Fintech; Peer-to-peer lending,"Purpose: The gradual implementation of blockchain technology in peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platforms facilitates safer, transparent and quick access to funds without having to deal with the more complex and costly processes of banks. Beyond that, the purpose of this paper is to examine trust-enhancing heuristics that show a need for blockchain to assist in monitoring and bad loan recovery. Design/methodology/approach: This study examines 909 lending decisions by 303 finance students on a mock P2P site. Each participant was asked to make three lending decisions. The loan applications were identical with the exception of a female or male photo (vs an icon) and reports of having raised half the loan in either 2 or 11 days (vs 7). Findings: Investors who have experienced financial trauma are more likely to herd and lend higher amounts to loan applicants that are highly trusted by other lenders. This effect is more pronounced for male investors lending to highly trusted female loan applicants. Practical implications: Blockchain can compensate for behavioral biases and improve monitoring by helping track digital money transactions and assisting in bad loan recovery efforts. Originality/value: This study is the first behavioral experiment to examine herding in P2P lending. The findings complement and corroborate those by Gonzalez and Komarova (2014, 2015) and emphasize the need for blockchain to assist beyond trusted records and safe transfers of funds. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85065777048

Regression analysis shows that consumer demand, net transactional benefits and perceived accessibility of accepting crypto-payments influence adoption intention and actual acceptance. Our findings also suggest that service providers who act as intermediaries in e-commerce play a crucial role as facilitators of competition and innovation by increasing accessibility. The most serious barrier for crypto-acceptance is a lack of consumer demand. It seems therefore unlikely that crypto adoption by online retailers will increase substantially in the near future. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85064560644

Each service has a different representation in a different platform even though targeting the same business objectives. This situation results in the problem of re-developing similar set of requirements for different devices and services which in turn results in multiplied effort in software development and degradation in the software quality because of the replicated code. The objective of this paper is to present a device independent user interface development approach that eliminates the replicated user interface development effort of the same set of services for different platforms/devices while increasing the presentation performance. In this context, we provide a basic technique that uses a json based user interface definition format, called omni-script, to separate the representation of banking services in different platforms/devices, so called channels. Omni-script is a pioneering solution being used in a real development environment in banking software domain that is experiencing a shift towards omni-channel user experience, where users are able to seamlessly continue using banking services in different platforms and devices. As the evaluation method, we have measured the actual development effort on a representative sample development team and a set of services. Additionally, we later deployed and measured the rendering time and the amount of data communication for the proposed approach in a real production environment. Production deployment resulted in a remarkable decrease in data communication and in loading times at the client side. As importantly, the proposed approach also resulted in a nearly 75% decrease in service development time by enabling analysts to produce user interface prototypes that can be integrated to service development with minimal effort. © 2019",Article,2-s2.0-85060113921

In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms’ industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM’s and Ethereum’s capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard’s results.

Under the background of financial technology (Fintech), how to select an appropriate technology company to cooperate for the banks has become a key. The technology company selection can be regarded as a kind of multi-attribute group decision making (MAGDM) problems. The probabilistic linguistic term set (PLTS) is a useful tool to express decision makers’ (DMs’) evaluations in the technology company selection. This paper develops a new method for MAGDM with PLTSs. Firstly, the possibility degree and range value of PLTSs are defined. Then a possibility degree algorithm is designed for ranking PLTSs. An Euclidean distance measure between PLTSs is presented and extended to probabilistic linguistic matrices. Based on Archimedean t-norm and s-norm, some new operational laws for PLTSs are defined and some desirable properties are discussed. Then, a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher weighted averaging (GPLHWA) operator and a generalized probabilistic linguistic Hamacher ordered weighted averaging (GPLHOWA) operator are developed. Some useful properties for these operators are investigated in detail. Combined with the subjective weights of DMs, the DMs’ weights are determined by the adjusted coefficients. Using the GPLHWA operator, the collective decision matrix is obtained by aggregating all the individual decision matrices. By maximizing the total weighted square possibility degree, a multi-objective program is constructed to derive the attribute weights. The ranking order of alternatives is generated by integrating ELECTRE and TOPSIS. Thereby, a new method is put forward for MAGDM with PLTSs. A Fintech example is analyzed to show the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Nevertheless, buyers sometimes struggle to persuade suppliers to adopt SCF quickly. To craft more effective supplier onboarding strategies, buyers need to know which suppliers are likely to adopt SCF faster. Drawing on the theoretical perspective on organizational motivation, we develop a research framework that uncovers the key drivers of supplier adoption speed. Our framework combines efficiency motive drivers, identified by recent analytical studies on SCF, with legitimacy motive drivers, which stem from a supplier's institutional environment and are new to the SCF literature. We test our hypotheses using a unique data set from a leading financial technology platform provider. We find that suppliers with more limited access to financing tend to adopt SCF faster. In addition, suppliers adopt SCF faster if such adoption is associated with more pronounced reductions in their financing costs. Legitimacy motive drivers also impact supplier adoption speed. Specifically, our results suggest that mimetic and normative pressures accelerate the speed at which suppliers adopt SCF, while coercive pressures seem to have such an effect only when the buyer's stakes are high. © 2019 Association for Supply Chain Management, Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85072869902

Commercial banks' interest in innovation is determined by the threat of steadily declining business profitability and a new competitive threat to traditional sources of income from new fin-technologies. Despite the active development of crypto-innovations (algorithms, platforms, crypto-currencies), the use of blockchain by banks in the financial sector is still very modest. Like most of the participants in this market, banks only carefully test computer technologies for managing a distributed ledger, and therefore objective barriers hindering progress in this area are of actual interest to specialists and researchers. The application of any innovative technology in the banking business depends on the successful compliance of new opportunities and time-tested requirements of consumers in the financial sector. In particular for the technology of the blockchain, just has not fully resolved key-problems of standardization, boundary identification, security and cyber-security, reliability of execution transaction, scalability of projects, etc. Here considered the main barriers, from the author's viewpoint, of implementation of the blockchain in the banking business, confirmed by the authoritative materials of centers for innovative financial technology. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85064176159

From cash payment to credit card payment, it is now possible to use smart devices to complete payment actions. In the field of payment, the annual output value in 2017 is as high as 720 billion dollars. Under such high output value, it naturally attracts a large number of manufacturers to enter this field. In so many manufacturers, how should users choose? However, users will consider the use of electronic currency. Directly affect the market share of each manufacturer, if you can start from the user's consideration point and implement the strategy improvement, it will definitely increase the market share. This study explores the user's consideration of electronic currency and the development of Financial technology, and establishes a causal loop diagram of users using electronic currency with system dynamics, while simulating mass transit, video games, E-commerce, and Financial technology and retailers will conduct which strategy and which points they want to improve when they are competing the users. By this way to get more amounts for market sharing and at the last offer, the most effective and useful strategy to vendors with different industry. The research found that the promotion strategy and the circulation strategy are most effective for each manufacturer. The strategy is to strengthen the preferential E-currency and the number of special stores. The popularity strategy has the lowest help to increase market share, so manufacturers should avoid it. The promotion of popularity is the main strategy, while the loyalty strategy is not effective for video game manufacturers and E-commerce vendors. Since users pay the most attention to discounts and convenience, if they can improve, they will attract more users. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85069788857

Open Banking is an innovative model for the financial industry not only from competition perspective but also from customer engagement perspective. Banks will have to help their customers with superior and more agile offerings. Banks should enable their customers to manage their financial affairs, make better decisions, save money etc. Digital disruption, FinTechs and Regulatory compliance such as Revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2) have accelerated the competition and forced banks to open up their systems. Using API, banks can transform their core systems for innovations and can integrate with internal system and external partners in a simpler, secure and controlled way.This paper takes a look at why open API is the foundation of open banking, values creating using open APIs, open banking framework/building blocks, and challenges faced by banks in implementing the open banking.

First, it is argued that the question that preoccupies ‘coherentists’ (concerning the application of the law of contract to smart contracts, and the fit between smart contracts and the paradigmatic ‘fiat contracts’ that are recognised by the law of contract) is neither as puzzling nor as important as might be supposed. Secondly, it is argued that, if there are concerns about the acceptability of smart contracts, then the conversation that needs to be had is of a ‘regulatory-instrumentalist’ nature; in particular, if the question is one of public policy restrictions on the use of smart contracts, then the appropriate balance of interests needs to be made by an institution that has both the necessary mandate and the appropriate mind-set. Thirdly, it is argued that there are conversations that we currently do not have but which urgently need to be had.

They need to re-evaluate their competitive advantages in light of profound changes driven by advances in information technology (IT) and competitive pressure from FinTech companies. This article emphasizes that banks should not abolish relationship banking, which nurtures close contact with bank customers. A long-term orientation of relationship banking streamlines incentives and supports the long-term needs of bank customers. However, banks might be lured into transaction banking due to the presence of IT-driven economies of scale and competition from FinTech start-ups and IT companies. In this light, the article evaluates the role of distances, artificial intelligence, and behavioral biases. Implications for stability in banking are explored.

Blockchain (BC) technology, being distributed and immutable in nature, has proved to the 'Trust Machine' eliminating the need for third-parties. Authors of this paper investigate how Blockchain can be used to secure stock exchange transactions, with an especial focus to the technological as well as legal aspects of such applications. Considering the intricate operational structure of the securities exchange, the research proposes to design, develop and implement a hybrid BC, customised according to the need of the respective stock exchange. The study suggests that the use of such BC can bring many benefits which the other technologies currently being used cannot offer.

Because it is a new phenomenon, there are few studies on blockchain, and those studies have focused mainly on the technology's potential impacts, whereas how to effectively implement it in an organization remains unknown. Our study intends to fill that gap. Using affordance-actualization (A-A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted a case study of blockchain implementation in an organization that has effectively implemented it. We identify three affordances of blockchain in the organization and a process model whereby these affordances are actualized. The process model extends A-A theory by adding an experimentation phase where blockchain's use cases within the organization are identified, developed and tested through conceptual adaptation and constraint mitigation. Our study makes important theoretical contributions to the literature on A-A theory, blockchain, information technology (IT) implementation, and strategic information systems (SIS).

While fintech implies more convenient and various financial services to customers, it leads to more complexity in the financial sector, as different industry players (e.g., IT firms) can participate in financial businesses. The complexity of fintech causes controversial issues related to policies and the appropriate development direction. In order to provide insight into the current state of fintech, this study explores the fundamental understanding of the fintech phenomenon from the perspective of the major stakeholders (i.e., financial authorities, financial companies, IT firms) in South Korea. This study analyzed news articles, where those stakeholders expressed their arguments, by using a content analysis.

Complete information is considered one that offers financial and non-financial information. Government and supranational authorities are starting to promulgate rules to construct a reasonable framework for non-financial disclosure. One consumer might make a social conscious decision if the information disclosed meets to the Directive 2014/95/UE guidelines. In order to analyse this condition in the e-credit market in Spain, this research measures the rank of compliance of European standards in non-financial disclosure. The main finding of this research is that non-financial information disclosure in the Spanish e-credit market is not sufficient to make informed decisions. Due to the fact that most of the non-financial information is focused on social issues related to a company's commitment to sustainability, non-financial information plays a relevant role in the building of an economically sustainable society. Our findings show that the level of non-financial disclosure in the Spanish e-Credit market is low, what supposes there is not an adequate informative base to decision making according to European standards on non-financial information. By considering the effect of usual disclosure drivers in this research field, the e-credit market sector was the only positive factor to disclose more non-financial information. Nevertheless, company size, company seniority and company location were not significant factors for non-financial disclosure. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,2-s2.0-85061125388
"Sinha M., Majra H., Hutchins J., Saxena R.",Mobile payments in India: the privacy factor,2019.0,Adoption readiness; Emerging markets; India; Mobile payments; Privacy concerns; Technology readiness,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to understand Indian consumers’ intention to use mobile payments by examining their adoption readiness (AR) in the larger context of their technology readiness (TR) and their privacy concerns (PCs). Design/methodology/approach: A four-city, three language, paper and pencil survey yielded a sample of 600 respondents from India. Data were analyzed using structural equations modeling. Findings: This study finds that AR positively mediates the relationship between TR and intention to adopt (IA) mobile payments. More importantly, PCs negatively moderate the relationship between AR and IA. Research limitations/implications: Results will vary depending on country and other variables outside the scope of this study such as perceived risk, trust, etc. The sample was large but mainly comprised males, between 18 and 35 years of age. Practical implications: The cash shortage due to a recent demonetization move in India had spurred mobile payment adoption but usage and retention remained low. Many other banking self-service technologies had not been successful and digitization was critical for easing payments and potentially paving the way for mobile banking. However, using mobile phones for financial transactions raises PCs that attenuate the positive impact of AR. Also, understanding overall attitudes with TR is important in a rapidly digitizing country with relatively novice users. Social implications: Adoption of mobile payment technology can help address social and economic challenges in India, such as financial inclusion, corruption and tax evasion. Given the increasing awareness of privacy issues in India, mobile payment adoption, which already faces acquisition and retention challenges, will likely to face greater resistance in the future. Originality/value: The findings add to the literature on emerging markets and marketing of technology products by identifying the critical role of privacy in the adoption of financial technology services. Moreover, the authors demonstrate that given the rapid introduction of technology in India, consumers’ overarching TR has to be considered along with AR for mobile payments. Thus, the authors offer a tripartite, customer–technology–transaction view of the mobile payment adoption process in India. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85053248448

"Yu T., Shen W.",Funds sharing regulation in the context of the sharing economy: Understanding the logic of China's P2P lending regulation,2019.0,Financial democracy; Financial regulation; P2P lending; Sharing economy,"“Sharing economy” is an umbrella term that encompasses a wide range of digital platform-based activities that includes P2P lending and other forms of internet-based lending. The core aim of the sharing economy is to leverage the utilization of idle capacity. P2P lending can not only be used to leverage small amounts of money on the lender's side, but also be used to promote financial democracy and inclusion both on the lender and borrower's sides. P2P lending regulation, therefore, should place an emphasis on the utilization of dead money and promotion of financial democracy. This article scrutinizes the regulation of P2P lending in China. The existing regulatory system for P2P lending in China is built upon rules and regulations that have been designed solely with traditional brokers in mind. The article contends that the rigid rules placed on lending platforms limited their ability to maintain their roles as brokers and, in turn, heavily endangered the commercial sustainability of P2P platforms, thereby harming the sharing economy's openness and inclusivity. Additionally, the article argues that the fact that there is no limit on the amount a lender can invest poses a threat to the notions of leveraging idle money and financial inclusivity. The closed-ended P2P lending regime in China would cause some chilling effects to financial innovation in the P2P lending industry, and in a wider sense, the rising FinTech sector. Regulators in China need to cope with these challenges in a flexible but pragmatic manner, and particularly make use of the benefits the sharing economy may bring to the Chinese economy more broadly. © 2018 Tao Yu and Wei Shen",Article,2-s2.0-85056484477

Yue L.,The financing of elderly care: Cross-industry diversification,2019.0,Financial regulation; Financial service for the elderly; Financial technology; Population aging Financial innovation,"Financial service for the elderly refers to the financial activities carried out by financial institutions to meet consumption, investment and derivative needs of social members in relation to retirement, with the objective of ""providing care for the elderly"", with a focus on ""services"" through ""financial means"". It involves a wide range of areas and has inclusiveness, long-term nature, stability, security and other characteristics. In recent years, as population ageing accelerates, a series of policies on financial service for the elderly have been introduced and financial institutions have also made several explorations in this fieldwhich is faced with problems such as homogeneous products and insufficient supply. In order to get out the predicaments faced by the development of the industry, we still need to improve the supportive policies, promote pension reforms, and clarify the regulatory framework. In the long run, driven by population aging, financial reforms, product innovation and the development of financial technology, the financial service for the elderly will unleash its great potential. © Social Sciences Academic Press and Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.

"Irwin A.S.M., Dawson C.",Following the cyber money trail: Global challenges when investigating ransomware attacks and how regulation can help,2019.0,Attribution; Bitcoin regulation; Cryptocurrency; Financial crime; Ransomware,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to show how global regulation of cryptocurrencies and other cybercurrencies can assist in addressing the challenges of attribution when investigating ransomware attacks and other types of cybercrime using these payment methods. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review, looking at current academic research and discourse on the topic cryptocurrency regulation, is conducted to highlight current thinking and perceived difficulties in implanting a global regulatory framework. In addition, the research explores how governments have addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and how regulation has been implemented. The research focuses on the regulatory approaches of Australia, Europe and the Americas to determine whether they could feasibly address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and be implemented on a global scale. Findings: To date, few sustained efforts have been made to regulate Bitcoin or other cybercurrencies. Where regulation has been introduced, it has often proven too costly to implement, thereby, stifling Bitcoin industry growth, or too ad hoc to function effectively. These regulatory pitfalls are substantiated by the continuing difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies, in identifying individual Bitcoin users and separating those that are using them for nefarious purposes from those that are using them for legitimate ones. These challenges appear to grow exponentially when it comes to prosecuting criminals for Bitcoin-related offences, due to the enormous lack of agreement within the justice system of most countries as to the appropriate legal definition for Bitcoin. This research highlights three characteristics that will be vital to the success of any global regulatory framework. These are consistency, clarity and cost-effective implementation. A regulatory framework for Bitcoin that lacks any one of these elements will fail to meet the requirements of every stakeholder in the regulatory process. A framework that is too costly to implement will stifle fintech innovation, subsequently depriving national economies of the multitude of potential benefits promised by fostering fintech entrepreneurship. Equally, a framework that is inconsistent will hamper the global cooperation necessary to combat Bitcoin-related crime. Originality/value: This research evaluates research, discourse and regulatory responses from academic and governmental sources and discusses how a global response to cryptocurrency regulation will help address the growing problem of attribution when it comes to ransomware attacks, which has experienced a considerable spike in recent months. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85064157660

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by financial institutions’ business. This study involved rural banks, commercial banks, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by net loan to assets while profit was assessed by return on assets. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after financial technology startups emerged. The study reveals that financial technology startups disrupt financial institutions’ business and performance because their total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural banks and multi-finance institutions.

This would suggest that the new types of (traditional) banking services and the new type of (traditional) banking service providers have emerged in the market. The paper describes the commercial banking services, the set-up commercial banks operate in and the changes occurring in the market triggered by financial technology (the FinTech firms). When researching the effects of financial technology, the paper focuses on the trends in the market and the efficiencies the new services are responsible for. The new service providers have shown that they are meeting the demands of the consumers/clients that banks have not, such as crowdfunding, or battling financial inclusion. The grand issue surrounding the FinTech sector is the lack of applicable regulatory environment. Challenges the regulators are faced with when designing the regulation applicable to the financial technology are the speed the services are evolving with and choosing the right moment to place regulation. The lack of adequate regulation leaves customers/clients unprotected. Nevertheless, the FinTech sector is growing rapidly. Indications in the market suggest the FinTech firms are leading the way the commercial banking sector will follow. © 2019 University of Zagreb Faculty of Economics and Business.

In this regard, regulatory sandboxes, which were recently introduced in several jurisdictions, provide a promising solution, as they imply a liberalization of regulatory requirements in order to enable FinTechs to test their innovative services. However, we observe that no comparable initiative exists in Germany, even though the German regulator identified a need for action on this subject in order to maintain its international competitiveness. Thus, based on a detailed analysis of various sandbox models worldwide, this paper develops a set of own recommendations as a basis for the implementation of a sandbox concept which might be applicable in the German regulatory environment. In doing so, we identify current theoretical as well as practical regulatory issues within the context of the rapid FinTech evolution. To the best of our knowledge, this paper represents the first study on key international sandboxes as a basis to design guidelines specifically for the German financial market. Thereby, we contribute to the literature as we evolve an effective regulation within the new setting of innovative financial technologies. Moreover, our findings contribute to the practical solution of current challenges faced by both regulators and affected companies. Even though our derived implications focus on the German financial sector, the results may potentially be applicable in further jurisdictions with similar regulatory requirements. © 2019, Duncker und Humblot GmbH.

"Sunmola F.T., Unal F.S.",Transitioning to sustainable manufacturing: A systematic review of considerations,2019.0,Key considerations; Sustainable manufacturing; Systematic review; Transition,"Manufacturing enterprises are transitioning to sustainable manufacturing, embracing the benefits of sustainability. In addition to manufacturer’s traditional focus on financials, the transition permits adoption of green and eco-friendly practices, improved considerations for human factors and social responsibilities, whilst reducing negative impact on nature, society and economy. Understandably, the transition requires considerations including in terms of financial, technology, and stakeholder commitments. This paper presents a systematic review of reported considerations for transitioning to sustainable manufacturing. Three main themes emerged from the review: a) clarity about the need for, and requirements for, sustainable manufacturing; b) appreciation of the drivers, constraints, challenges, enablers and barriers; and c) availability of support necessary for implementing the transition. It is concluded that manufacturing enterprises should be selective in their choice of transition path and take into consideration all the three identified themes in their sustainability transition process. © 2019, Computers and Industrial Engineering.

FinTechs are companies that combine technological and financial attributes in their business models. In recent years, the rise of FinTech has attracted much attention since they challenge incumbent financial service companies including the traditional banking model. Innovative FinTech Business Models are Bitcoin, Tag Cash, Oradian, Satago, Simple Tax, Transfer wise, Holvi and TRDATA able to become a success because they could reach out to a humungous Global market. However, the growth in FinTech industry has not spurred up only because of small-scale entrepreneurs; the role of major financial industries cannot be neglected in this regard. The entrepreneurs work at small-scale in the FinTech industry. They have the capacity to bear the risk of failure in a better way as compared to the major financial institutions. Financial institutions work entirely on public trust. They are highly regulated by the financial authorities in order to add up to their reliability. These financial institutions are answerable to the public for all their operations and therefore, they have to closely guard their investment choices. © 2019, Institute of Advanced Scientific Research, Inc..

From the perspective of government dual-objective optimization, two strategies “First regulate and then motivate” and “First motivate and then regulate” are presented, respectively. The timing strategy choice of supervision and incentive of P2P platform is analyzed through game theory modeling and numerical simulation. The results show that the government should first motivate and then regulate the P2P lending platforms; moreover, in the parallel stage of regulatory and incentive mechanism, the government should pay more attention to the economic benefits brought by the P2P lending industry so as to achieve the dual-objective optimization and utility maximization.

These include a wide array of tools to mitigate risks arising from the distinct risk factors that are further consolidated under the risk strategy of a specific enterprise. Any firm in space industry and outside of it faces risks that can be associated with the following key areas: strategic, reputational, regulatory, financial, operational, and cyber. Integrating high tech solutions into the risk mitigation process has now become available by implementing solutions based on artificial intelligence technology. Recent advances in risk management are numerous and include regulatory technology (RegTech) and financial technology (FinTech) solutions that are necessary in the competitive environment. Conservative risk mitigation methods are not fast paced enough to conduct numerous iterations in a split second timeframe and tackle arising risks. For instance, the new regulatory framework design for the company will be more efficient if it grounds on the RegTech concept. The latter automates the state-of-the-art risk mitigation methods and allows for integrating human expertise and newest technology. All in all, better governance and information management are key in the strategic risk management of any enterprise. Finally, risk mitigation plays a crucial role in reaching the organization's goals. Copyright © 2019 by the International Astronautical Federation (IAF).

One of the most important findings in this literature is how various types of actors are increasingly getting involved in financial market investments and practices. Norwegian municipalities belong among these new groups of actors. In fact, financial portfolio management is emerging as a common option in the toolkit of Norwegian public sector property management. In this article, I investigate the relations between municipalities and their financial brokers. I argue that the contact surface between local authorities and the financial markets is characterized by intimate and long-lasting relationships of trust, and that this is an important factor when trying to explain how public sector decision makers come to consider financial technologies rational and fitting for the needs of the public sector. © 2019 Universitetsforlaget AS.

Nabilou H.,Testing the waters of the Rubicon: the European Central Bank and central bank digital currencies,2019.0,Bitcoin; Central bank; Central bank digital currency; Cryptocurrency; European Central Bank; Money,"Breakthroughs in financial technology (fintech), ranging from early coins and banknotes to card payments, e-money, mobile payments, and, more recently, cryptocurrencies, portend transformative changes to the financial and monetary systems. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies bear a significant resemblance to base money or central bank money. This functional similarity can potentially pose several challenges to central banks in various dimensions. It may pose risks to central banks’ monopoly over issuing base money, price stability, the smooth operation of payment systems, the conduct of monetary policy, and to the stability of credit institutions and the financial system. From among several potential policy responses, central banks have been investigating and experimenting with issuing central bank digital currency (CBDC). This paper investigates CBDC from a legal perspective and sheds light on the legal challenges of introducing CBDC in the euro area. Having studied the potential impact of issuing CBDC by the European Central Bank (ECB), particularly on the banking and financial stability, the efficient allocation of resources (i.e. credit), as well as on the conduct of monetary policy, the paper concludes that issuing CBDC by the ECB would face a set of legal challenges that need to be resolved before its issuance at the eurozone level. Resolving such legal challenges may prove to be an arduous task as it may ultimately need amendments to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. © 2019, Springer Nature Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85071227668

Due to a great number of customers, e-commerce companies often employ multiple communication channels to answer customers' questions, for example, Chatbot and Hotline. On one hand, each channel has limited capacity to respond to customers' requests; on the other hand, customers have different preferences over these channels. The current production systems are mainly built based on business rules that merely consider the tradeoffs between the resources and customers' satisfaction. To achieve the optimal tradeoff between the resources and customers' satisfaction, we propose a new framework based on deep reinforcement learning that directly takes both resources and user model into account. In addition to the framework, we also propose a new deep-reinforcement-learning-based routing method-double dueling deep Q-learning with prioritized experience replay (PER-DoDDQN). We evaluate our proposed framework and method using both synthetic and a real customer service log data from a large financial technology company. We show that our proposed deep-reinforcement-learning-based framework is superior to the existing production system. Moreover, we also show that our proposed PER-DoDDQN is better than all other deep Q-learning variants in practice, which provides a more optimal routing plan. These observations suggest that our proposed method can seek the tradeoff, where both channel resources and customers' satisfaction are optimal. © 2013 IEEE.",Article,2-s2.0-85071187362

Design/methodology/approach: A qualitative approach is used to identify risk factors related to the use of new financial innovations, by examining how over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives contributed to the Global Financial Crisis (GFC) which occurred during 2007 and 2008. Based on this analysis, the potential for similar concerns with smart contracts are evaluated, drawing on the failure of The DAO on the Ethereum blockchain, which involved the loss of over $60m of digital currency. Findings: Extensive use of bilateral agreements, complexity and lack of standardization, lack of transparency, misuse and speed of contagion were factors that contributed to the GFC that could also become material concerns for smart contract technology as its adoption grows. These concerns, combined with other contextual factors, such as the risk of defects in smart contracts and cyberattacks, could lead to potential destabilization of the broader financial system. Practical implications: The paper’s findings provide insights to help make the design, management and monitoring of smart contract technology more robust. They also provide guidance for key stakeholders on proactive steps that can be taken with smart contract technology to avoid repeating the types of oversights that contributed to the GFC. Originality/value: This paper draws attention to the risks associated with the adoption of disruptive FinTech. It also suggests steps that regulators and other key stakeholders can take to help mitigate those risks. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85078313391

A number of authors argue that government issued digital currency is necessary to address the flaws in private crypto currencies, and to improve moneta ry policy effectiveness. Central banks have begun to analyze possible features of digitalized legal tenders, to better understand the policy considerations involved and effects these could have for interest rate transmission and financial markets, but ther e is no clear consensus on key modalities associated with digitalized legal tenders. Moreover, many central banks do not regard privately issued virtual currencies as a serious threat to traditional currencies. Given the ongoing debate, it is difficult to make firm predictions about the impact of central bank issued digital currencies on monetary policy transmission and financial markets at this point. © 2019 Sciedu Press.",Article,2-s2.0-85071229705

It depends on trust and cognitive perspectives,2019.0,Cognitive based trust; Continuance intention; Information quality; Mobile payment; Perceived privacy protection; Perceived security protection; Trust,"The rapid growth of mobile payment as the part of Financial Technology (FinTech) could lead to empirical problems (e.g. hacker attacks, privacy violation, etc) that results low cognitive based trust and lower loyalty among users. Hence, there are some proclivities for users' continuance intention on trust and its cognitive perspective regarding their funds that has been transferred to mobile payment platform. In order to understand the proclivity, we collect primary data from 165 users of mobile payment platform in Jakarta Indonesia and develop the hypotheses regarding the continuance intention that depends on trust and cognitive perspectives. To test the hypotheses, this study employs Partial Least Square - Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings show that the cognitive based trust dimensions such as information quality and privacy are insignificant on continuance intention. On the other hand, perceived security protection shows positive influence. Simultaneously, only information quality and security protection have significantly and positive influence on trust, while privacy perception are insignificant on trust and continuance intention. This study also shows that trust has more determining role toward continuance intention than the cognitive perspective. This study contributes in specifying cognitive dimension and trust on continuance intention. Therefore, it suggests the mobile payment companies to improve quality, reliability, and information updates. Furthermore, they also need to improve the security protection that refers to personalization among users of the mobile payment to gain more trust and achieve customers' retention. © 2019 The Authors.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85078948069

The causes for lack of proper hygienic conditions in India are many like poverty of the people, low level of literacy, cultural & religious customs of different groups etc. Due to the uncleanliness of the places, the Indian public is subjected to many diseases and discomforts. Even after seven decades of attaining independence, the situation has not changed for better. Realizing the importance of cleanliness in the country, the Government of India launched a special initiative called ``Swachha Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Campaign) under the aegis of Ministry of drinking water & sanitation on 2nd October, 2014 commemorating the birth day of the Father of the Nation. The campaign has attracted many stakeholders like State Governments, NGOs, Corporates of Public and Private sectors. The aim is to make India a clean country by 2019. This is the biggest behavioral change initiative taken by the Government in post independent era. ONGC, a Maharatna company and Numero Uno of public sector companies in India has also drawn numerous programmes in line with the mission of ``Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’’. (Clean India Campaign).

The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation. © 2019 Institute of Society Transformation.",Article,2-s2.0-85072249901
Klimontowicz M.,The role of banks' innovativeness in building sustainable efficiency: The case of Poland,2019.0,Banks' efficiency; Banks' innovativeness; Competitive advantage; Financial technology; Knowledge-based intangibles; Market performance,"New technology has already influenced almost all aspect of human life. Innovativeness is considered as one of the most important requirements for both companies and employees. Even such traditional entities like banks should develop their propensity and ability to incorporate changes in business practices through the creation and adoption of new ideas, solutions, and technology. Today, as a result of significant changes on banking markets, the innovativeness becomes one of the condition for banks' sustainability. Strong competition increased by a necessity to compete with new market players requires developing new managers and employees' skills as creativity and intrapreneurship. The purpose of the paper is to investigate to what extent bank's innovativeness impacts a bank's efficiency that lead to sustainable market position. It presents banks' innovativeness among other competitive advantage factors, their assessment from the perspective of their potential in the process of building bank's competitive advantage and a correlation between the level of bank's innovativeness and market efficiency. The majority of the innovativeness research concentrate on developed countries and very little is known about developing, transition countries. Moreover, the few of them explore banks as a specific entity. On the banking market, they focus rather on distribution channels or product innovations. To the best authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to empirically examine the relationship between a bank's innovativeness and market efficiency in a transition banking market in Europe. The paper uses data retrieved from the research survey. The survey's target group consisted of all retail banks operating in Poland defined as banks that offer a broad range of financial services to different segments of individual customers. The research was conducted under the auspices of the Polish Banks Association. The data was collected by two methods - PAPI (personal and pencil interviews) and CAWI (computer assisted web interviews). The questionnaire was applied to executive managers of retail banks operating on Polish banking market and banks' customers. The data used for assessing banks' efficiency were derived from banks' annual reports. The results provide direction for banks' decision makers concerning innovativeness' factors that should be taken into account in the process of building competitive advantage and sustainable market performance. © 2019 by author(s) and VsI Entrepreneurship and Sustainability Center This work is licensed under the Creative Commons Attribution International License (CC BY). http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/",Article,2-s2.0-85073191024

The FinTech revolution has given rise to a vast number of technology-oriented market entrants who challenge many parts of the financial services industry. This research seeks to provide a better understanding of how FinTechs across various business functions fundamentally impact the value chain in this industry. To this end, we built on top of financial intermediation theory, and developed a taxonomy of FinTechs' intermediating functions. The following hierarchical clustering analysis identified six archetypes of FinTech intermediaries as observed in the real world, i.e. the different ways in which FinTechs across business functions act as financial intermediaries by transforming assets, reducing transaction cost, and alleviating information asymmetries. Finally, we discuss how FinTechs impact financial intermediation in itself, and to what extent the notion of FinTechs disintermediating the financial value chain is accurate. © Proceedings of the 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Secure ICT Platform for the 4th Industrial Revolution, PACIS 2019.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089244215

These so-called FinTechs are characterized by highly innovative capacities, rapid development methods and a short time to market for their services and technical solutions. This external source of innovation can pose a competitive threat to traditional financial service companies or, on the contrary, may add value by serving as an additional resource for new ideas and technical solutions. Using a multiple case study approach, 18 interviews were conducted with representatives of FinTechs, financial services corporations, and specialized consulting firms. We study how large corporations and FinTechs interact with each other, what organizational setups were chosen and how knowledge transfer is organized for successful collaboration. Our results indicate that the organizational setup, split into three dimensions, has a strong impact on the integration of external knowledge which, in turn, affects the success of innovation sourcing. © Proceedings of the 23rd Pacific Asia Conference on Information Systems: Secure ICT Platform for the 4th Industrial Revolution, PACIS 2019.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089232848

These technologies create market segments which are small initially and have not been targeted by the existing companies. Startups are leveraging these types of innovations and are giving tough fight to the traditional organizations. These organizations need to project themselves as the technology leaders, else there is a constant threat for them to be thrown out of the market by new disruptors. This paper investigates technology used by a startup which has the potential to disrupt existing business models. This paper adopts a case-based approach which is a startup along with specific comparison with those organizations which are still relying on traditional methods. For comparison purpose, Paytm is taken as the subject which is leveraging on digital technologies to break the conventional practices followed by brick and mortar banking system. Analysis is done on how Paytm has grown in an accelerated manner by taking advantage of penetration of financial services in India. Favourable ecosystems in the form of government support and markets available in countries like India has definitely fuelled the growth of Paytm. Research also analyses the funding opportunities which have been tapped by Paytm from giant foreign investors like Alibaba group, SoftBank and Berkshire Hathaway. These disruptors do not rely only on opportunity discovery, but also on opportunity creation. They work on combining discovery and creation to tap wide range of possibilities. For example, Paytm has become a synonym for online money transactions. It is also found that these entrepreneurial innovators make optimum use of available resources for their start-ups to create multiple segments of customers. Paytm is also trying to venture into the field of investment banking and fund management for profitability and sustainability of its business.

Technology offers South African banks the opportunity to address inherent socio-economic imbalances in the economy. However, the potential systemic risk it poses threatens to aggravate the situation if it not properly regulated. This paper uses a non-positivist, qualitative research design - the case study approach - to argue that South African banks have adopted a measured mindset to adopting Fintech because they are fundamentally risk-averse. Structural socio-economic imbalances, legacy systems, and a banking industry that has traditionally been conservative are argued to be the main drivers of this. The findings posited by this paper are intended to sensitise policymakers to the thinking of South African banks when formulating policies that address developments in Fintech in the future. © 2019 Adonis and Abbey Publishers Ltd.

The cashless system is not just a necessity but also a need of today’s order. Over the past few years, efforts to drive financial inclusion in India have delivered mixed results. Access to bank accounts has increased dramatically, driven by a strong policy and regulatory push. However, the usage of these accounts and the uptake of formal financial services beyond savings accounts has remained exceptionally difficult. The recent initiatives by the Government around demonetization and the move to cashless transactions will further drive innovation and new entrants into the Indust ry. The amendment s to the banking act clearly demonst rate the Government, RBI and Banking institutions intent to ensure stable growth of the economy by ensuring a healthy BFSI. Building Trust within the industry will be paramount to India’s further growth. Newer technologies pose different challenges to the banks and regulators, with security being a key concern. With cyber-frauds on the rise, the regulators and the bankers would have to come together to ensure control mechanisms are in place.

Coin F.,"Your data or your life. On demonetisation, cashlessness and the digital panopticon in India",2019.0,Aadhaar; Cashlessness; Demonetization; Digital panopticon; Platform economy,"Over the past few years, there has been a growing discussion about cashlessness. In several countries, economists, policy markers and financial institutions have advocated for a transition towards digital transactions, arguing that cashlessness can become an instrument of governance pivotal to the achievement of a more transparent and inclusive society. Conversely, cash has been described as a symbol of deviance, a symptom of illegal activities such as tax evasion and corruption. This paper focuses on the transition towards cashless transactions in India. Drawing on Noemi Klein’s definition of the shock economy, it argues that demonetisation in India can be considered as a shock therapy meant to facilitate the pursuit of a pro-corporate agenda. In a cash-based economy like India, demonetisation created a state of shock that forced large sectors of the population to adapt to digital transaction, in a process that undermined informal activities and used fear as a levy to push forward an agenda that largely benefited big credit card companies, the IT sector and fintech.

Being in their early stages, Malaysia and its counterparts from the GCC states have the potentials to becoming leaders in the Islamic fintech industry and may work together to develop a necessary framework for Islamic fintech advancement. Peer-to-peer arrangement connects crowdfunding investors with entrepreneurs through more transparency, speed dealings and almost free from complications in the documentation. In view of the fact that mushārakah is becoming more practical under the concept of Islamic peer-to-peer deals, this paper attempts to develop a new peer-to-peer financing which is underlain by the Mushārakah Smart Contract Model. The paper proposes a mushārakah model using Mushārakah Smart Contract in which the investors would be crediting their investments for mushārakah purposes with virtual lenders for specific Sharīʽah compliant businesses and share in the profit, based on an agreed dividend under the mushārakah principles. It also highlights the potential structures, cyber risks, and devices to mitigate them by using mushārakah standards and measures within the Sharīʽah principles. © 2019, International Islamic University Malaysia.

Semko R.,Machine learning for robo-advisors: Testing for neurons specialization,2019.0,Fintech; Machine learning; Neural network; Portfolio optimization; Robo-advisor; Wealth management,"The rise of robo-advisor wealth management services, which constitute a key element of fintech revolution, unveils the question whether they can dominate human-based advice, namely how to address the client's behavioral biases in an automated way. One approach to it would be the application of machine learning tools during client profiling. However, trained neural network is often considered as a black box, which may raise concerns from the customers and regulators in terms of model validity, transparency, and related risks. In order to address these issues and shed more light on how neurons work, especially to figure out how they perform computation at intermediate layers, this paper visualizes and estimates the neurons' sensitivity to different input parameters. Before it, the comprehensive review of the most popular optimization algorithms is presented and based on them respective data set is generated to train convolutional neural network. It was found that selected hidden units to some extent are not only specializing in the reaction to such features as, for example, risk, return or risk-aversion level but also they are learning more complex concepts like Sharpe ratio. These findings should help to understand robo-advisor mechanics deeper, which finally will provide more room to improve and significantly innovate the automated wealth management process and make it more transparent. © Roman Semko, 2019",Review,2-s2.0-85078104081

"Méndez-Suárez M., García-Fernández F., Gallardo F.",Artificial intelligence modelling framework for financial automated advising in the copper market,2019.0,Artificial intelligence; Commodity investment; Copper investment; Financial innovation; Fintech; Neural networks; Robo-advisor,"Financial innovation by means of Fintech firms is one of the more disruptive business model innovations from the latest years. Specifically, in the financial advisor sector, worldwide assets under management of artificial intelligence (AI)-based investment firms, or robo-advisors, currently amount to US$975.5 B. Since 2008, robo-advisors have evolved from passive advising to active data-driven investment management, requiring AI models capable of predicting financial asset prices on time to switch positions. In this research, an artificial neural network modelling framework is specifically designed to be used as an active data-driven robo-advisor due to its ability to forecast with today's copper prices five days ahead of changes in prices using input data that can be fed automatically in the model. The model, tested using data of the two periods with a higher volatility of the returns of the recent history of copper prices (May 2006 to September 2008 and September 2008 to September 2010) showed that the method is capable of predicting in-sample and out-of-sample prices and consequently changes in prices with high levels of accuracy. Additionally, with a 24-day window of out-of-sample data, a trading simulation exercise was performed, consisting of staying long if the model predicts a rise in price or switching to a short position if the model predicts a decrease in price, and comparing the results with the passive strategies, buy and hold or sell and hold. The results obtained seem promising in terms of both statistical and trading metrics. Our contribution is twofold: 1) we propose a set of input variables based on financial theory that can be collected and fed automatically by the algorithm. 2) We generate predictions five days in advance that can be used to reposition the portfolio in active investment strategies. © 2019 by the authors.",Article,2-s2.0-85077845354

In the Middle East, Gulf countries are facing serious economic growth challenges since the collapse of oil prices in 2014. This paper analyzes the main socio-economic and demographic factors of financial literacy among University students. The data is collected though an online survey submitted to a randomly selected sample of 2500 students from the University of Sharjah in the UAE. The survey includes 32 questions adapted to the Gulf context covering knowledge, behavior and attitude dimensions. The results of the main binary logistic regression show that the most vulnerable students in multidimensional financial literacy are UAE national females, studying in the undergraduate level, majoring in non-scientific areas, who did not take the Personal Finance course (University elective), with a lower CGPA and a lower family income. It was found that 31.36% of students who responded to the survey are classified as financially literate. Logistic regressions considering each of the three dimensions of financial literacy were performed with the same predictors. The results confirm that most of the explanatory variables are significant in predicting the category of financial knowledge. However, they fail to predict the categories of financial behavior and attitude. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85077384692

Peer-to-peer lending attracts new economic entities to the financial market and expands the boundaries of lending. Moreover, it provides additional development opportunities for participation in the process of redistributing financial resources from one person to another without the participation of traditional financial intermediaries, such as banks. The global peer-to-peer lending function is to satisfy the changing needs of individuals and legal entities by expanding their financial capabilities. In Russia, peer-to-peer lending is based on a loan agreement and peer-to-peer platforms act as intermediaries between lenders and borrowers. Peer-to-peer platforms perform several functions that are generally aimed not only at making a profit but also at developing the financial market as a whole. The authors of the study suggest systematizing the functions of peer-to-peer lending in general and peer-to-peer platforms in particular and also develop an original classification of peer-to-peer loans.

Degerli K.,Regulatory Challenges and Solutions for Fintech in Turkey,2019.0,Finance; Fintech; Planning; Regulation,"Regulators often have three different approaches when it comes to regulating FinTech; Ignore, liken, or regulate. As one of the most regulated sectors in Turkish economy, financial services are far from being ignored. FinTech companies in Turkey have been developing innovative products and services that provide great value for consumers and businesses. Fast pace of development in areas based on electronic services such as e-invoice, e-payments, e-government services, importance of FinTechs have become more apparent with their agility in taking action and offering innovative services. However, as agile as they might be, FinTech companies tend to ignore the regulations which financial institutions are subject to. ""If it works here, it works everywhere"" approach may have a serious downside when it comes to execution stage. From definition of the service to areas of application, to formation of the company and background of the investors, the ever-dictating financial sector regulations change dramatically from one country to another. As in the example of popular payment provider PayPal, failing to keep primary systems domestically may lead to a rejection of license application from BRSA (Banking Regulation and Supervision Agency) [1] Another example of such regulations is the need to do Due Diligence and monitor suspicious customer activity for AML/CTF purposes for some FinTechs in payment industry. Such requirements can be daunting for a technology-oriented point of view, and many of these companies face these facts at a later stage when they try to coexist or collaborate with other financial institutions. As these requirements may alter operational costs, human resources, and even IT infrastructure, they struggle to find investment or sign contracts with financial institutions. This study covers both successful and unsuccessful FinTech projects in payments and their position against regulations and offer remediations for better acceptance within Turkish financial sector. © 2019 The Authors.

The reluctance and inability of mainstream banks in the post-crisis years to provide credit facilities to the real economy, most critically to start-ups and small and medium-sized enterprises, propelled the latest wave of financial innovation, this time under the guise of FinTech. Much has been written on the rise of FinTech in recent years, but there is still insufficient clarity about the benefits that this phenomenon is bringing to the real economy and the potential risks that can arise from its growth. This paper maps the development of FinTech lending platforms in the UK and reconceptualises the rationale for their growth. In doing that, this study focuses on the structure and operation of the main UK platforms, recognising that while some are effectively banks that adopt a technology-based business model, many platforms operate under the P2P business model. The question then is to assess the policy and regulatory approach that is relevant to UK P2P platforms. Interestingly, the emergence of P2P securitisation raises a number of regulatory and policy questions, because longer intermediation chains typical of securitisation may well defy the social and economic purposes under which the idea of P2P developed. Furthermore, questions of systemic risk inevitably resurface in these types of transactions. Ensuing problems related to the best way to regulate these new channels of financial intermediation lead to critically evaluate the initiatives launched by the UK FCA, initially under the Innovation Hub, and more recently under the consultation for a new regulatory framework. © 2019, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85075352632

In this paper, we argue that the ways in which evolutionary economic geography impacts strategic coupling in global financial networks are crucial to grasp tomorrow’s geographies of Fintech. Through an in-depth examination of Brussels, we analyse the potential of Fintech opening a window of locational opportunity in financial services. Belgium has put together a strategy to seize this window by leveraging its politically neutral image and Brussels’ existing niche in financial collaboration and infrastructural plumbing. The latter status is exemplified by the presence of global players SWIFT and Euroclear. We analyse how Belgian entrepreneurs and politicians assess Brussels’ locational resources, and strategically couple big financial institutions with small tech startups in order to cultivate a Fintech ecosystem in the service of incumbent finance, constituting a Fin-Tech-State triangle. As such, we document and analyse how the coalescence of finance and technology offers new opportunities for second-tier financial centres, while highlighting the difficulties in reaping these in practice. © The Author(s) 2019.",Article,2-s2.0-85075214266

"Okello Candiya Bongomin G., Ntayi J.",Trust: mediator between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion,2019.0,Customers’ data; MNOs’ integrity; Mobile money fraud; MSMEs; Opportunism; Trust,"Purpose: Recently, a large body of research has been devoted on the role of trust in shaping different types of transactions, especially in rural financial development. Trust is a set of expectations shared by all those who engage in an exchange. Indeed, the “rule of the game” suggests that no trusting party in a transaction should act opportunistically. Consequently, this study aims to establish the mediating effect of trust in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion of MSMEs in developing countries with a specific focus on rural Uganda. Design/methodology/approach: A quantitative survey-based study was used and responses obtained from 379 MSMEs located in northern Uganda were analysed using partial least square-PLS version 3.0. A semi-structured questionnaire was developed from scales and items used in previous studies referenced in internationally recognised journals to elicit responses from the MSMEs. Structural equation modelling was used to test the models to arrive at a final empirical model derived from the data. Findings: The authors found evidence that trust enhances mobile money adoption and usage to increase the scope of financial inclusion of MSMEs in developing countries. Moreover, when individual effect was determined, trust also had significant and positive effect on financial inclusion. Thus, the study results imply that trust enhances mobile money adoption and usage to improve the level of financial inclusion of MSMEs in developing countries. Research limitations/implications: The study used cross-sectional data to document the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion and to establish the mediating effect of trust in the relationship. Future research could use relevant longitudinal data to verify other benefits of trust. Practical implications: The results present trust as a significant factor for FINTECH financial services marketing and growth. Specifically, data privacy and effectiveness of the mobile telephone network is more likely to help consumers to bridge the gap between participation and non-participation on the mobile money platform. Customers’ data sent over the mobile network of providers should be protected from unnecessary access and usage by Mobile Network Operators (MNOs) staff and unauthorised persons and agents. Data protection protocols should be set by the MNOs to avoid unnecessary access and use of customers’ data. Originality/value: Globally, Fintech scholars have examined the role of mobile money in promoting financial inclusion. However, there is insufficient evidence on the mediating effect of trust in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion, especially among rural MSMEs. This study invents a novel direction on the importance of trust in creating transaction efficiency by eliminating opportunism and fraud with in the Fintech ecosystem. © 2019, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85074041762
"Laidroo L., Avarmaa M.",The role of location in FinTech formation,2019.0,FinTechs; location; Porter’s diamond model; start-up establishment,"Given the rapid emergence of FinTechs, the objective of this paper is to determine location-specific factors associated with FinTech establishment intensity using Porter’s diamond framework. The analysis is based on a country-level dataset covering the period of 2007–2017 and 107 countries. The results reveal that greater FinTech establishment intensity characterizes smaller countries, countries with stronger information and communications technology (ICT) services clusters, and countries that have experienced a crisis during the recent decade. Greater FinTech establishment intensity is also observed in countries with greater tertiary education enrolment rates, stronger university-industry cooperation, greater fixed line availability, and overall ICT readiness. The macroeconomic situation and indicators of financial development prove to be important determinants of FinTech formation. Given the importance of several dimensions of location’s diamond in FinTech formation, FinTech entrepreneurs could benefit from a careful analysis of the diamond of locations that they are considering as potential places of doing business. Countries hoping to become more attractive FinTech establishment sites, in turn, should focus on the elimination of weaknesses in the location’s diamond in close co-operation with FinTechs. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85074019378

This creates a demand for an ultra-short tenor interest rate curve that is updated in real-time. Our paper develops a practical market model for the equilibrium intraday interest rates which provides market makers adequate incentives to attenuate flash crashes. Our model suggests that the intraday CHF interest rates should have been highly negative during the flash crash of EURCHF on 15 January 2015, which could potentially stop the long CHF short EUR strategy and reduce the severity of the crash. © 2019, © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85073962941

To realize this enhanced productivity, Business Process Management (BPM) maturity models are often used to analyze, improve and manage business processes across the organization. Literature suggests that a relation between BPM maturity and innovation could exist and recommends more research in specific sectors. Specifically, the financial sector is facing a fintech revolution, putting an enormous pressure on how they deal with technology innovation, process disruption and service transformation. Therefore, the objective of this research is to determine the relation between business process management maturity and innovation in the financial sector. Data was collected using a survey at a large financial enterprise in Europe, resulting in sixty-eight responses. Regression analysis shows that 20.6% of the variance in innovation can be explained by BPM maturity. © 2019 IADIS Press. All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85073913988

The complex is rapidly evolving, by the end of July 2018 there were about 1700 cryptoprojects globally. The cryptocomplex includes separate cryptosystems linked into a single network via cryptocurrencies trade. The article reveals economic nature and business models of the three largest and most famous cryptosystems – Bitcoin, Ethereum и Ripple, which are responsible for about 70% of the global cryptocomplex capitalization. Though Bitcoin and Ethereum try to create the alternative to the traditional financial system, Ripple proposes new cutting edge technological and effective decisions for the existing banking and payments systems. The authors show that the largest global private cryptosystem Bitcoin, whose goal is substitution of fiat money with bitcoin cryptocurrency, in reality is far away from the ideal system of distributed money, which automatically maintains deals between peers via the neutral computer code. Bitcoin, as well as other systems of cryptocurrencies, has inherent hierarchy and vivid monopoly effects. De-facto control over the Bitcoin functioning rests with the largest players, who replaced the central bank. These players are the main beneficiaries of recurrent rise in capitalization of cryptocurrencies. The strategic task of making bitcoin an alternative to fiat money as a mean of payments has failed. Due to the excessive price volatility bitcoin failed to become a worthy alternative to fiat money and traditional assets as a mean of saving for broad categories of investors. Ethereum and Ripple business models are weakly linked to the dynamics of cryptocurrencies development, serving these systems. Ethereum business model provides for maximization of incomes, rents and other benefits for the system creators from its extensive development. Ripple made an economic bet on selling its special digital solutions to traditional players in financial markets. The authors make a conclusion that cryptocurrencies effectively serve interests of the two clienteles. First are the pioneers of financial sector digitalization, including computer programmers, computer engineers, cryptography and game theory experts as well as venture investors working in parallel. Second are economic agents engaged into various illegal and criminal activities. The authors forecast that given the policies of financial markets regulators the pseudo anonymity of transactions in the sector of cryptocurrencies will cease to exist in the nearest future. © 2019 Academic Educational Forum on International Relations.

Research of such an innovative form of a credit institution is made in this paper, the concept of a digital bank is defined, various classifications of digital banks are reviewed and presented, criteria and characteristics are identified, by which these financial institutions can be classified. A study of the global market of digital banks was carried out using the proposed classification. The paper touches upon market segments that include digital banks built on models of classical financial institutions, and challenger banks, whose model is not built on the basis of a classical bank model, but are considered to be largely telecommunications companies offering financial services. The number of such banking organizations, the volume of capital managed by digital banks, the number of clients of relevant financial institutions, and the countries identified as leaders in forming a new form of credit organization were analyzed in the study. Promising directions for the development of digital banks were determined based on this analysis. One of the main tasks in the implementation of any innovative investment project is to evaluate its economic efficiency. In this regard, the paper analyzes the development model of the largest digital financial institution in the world - Tinkoff Bank, which was established and operates in the territory of the Russian Federation. A comparative analysis of traditional financial institutions against this bank was conducted in the study by key parameters: profitability, return on assets and the long-term capital. The research revealed that the financial digital institution model is effective and sustainable not only under favourable conditions of the economic development but also in crisis conditions. This is the best evidence of the economic efficiency of the proposed business model of the financial institution, which allows their development in all economic situations. © Proceedings of the 14th European Conference on Innovation and Entrepreneurship, ECIE 2019.

The authors perform a study on information technology impact on competency management in the financial sector of Latvia based on the technology management competency model. The authors have executed extensive academic literature review and interviews with leading fintech industry experts. The research team performed mixed research combining qualitative and qualitative methods. The process of the quantitative research was designed as a collection of publicly available financial statement data from lursoft.lv (enterprise database) for selected fintech companies and the analysis of financial data by comparing different fintech companies. The process of the qualitative research was designed as face-to-face expert interviews and the definition of central interview questions for the research based on the literature review and related sub-questions. The authors use the one-way analysis of variance technique and prove that competency management differs among fintech companies by comparing average turnover per employee of platform and credit companies. The finding persuades the authors to propose a fundamental fintech competency model to ensure competitiveness and sustainability of fintech companies. The objective of the research is to define a fundamental set of competencies linked with information technology management for financial sector companies to maintain competitiveness. Results prove that current set of competencies employed by fintech companies represents sufficient technical competencies. The conclusions demonstrate that fintech companies tend to have different competency management models. The research team concludes that soft skills development, data analytics using advanced data analytic tools, technology awareness, the ability and experience to use open source technology tools to develop technology solutions without deep technology competency, the ability to see the big picture, and interconnections between processes are competencies of the future. © 2019 Andris Natrins, Lasma Supe, Elina Mikelsone, Andris Sarnovics.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85073007912

"Fernández-Torres Y., Gutiérrez-Fernández M., Palomo-Zurdo R.",How do co-operative banks perceive the impact of digital transformation? [¿Cómo percibe la banca cooperativa el impacto de la transformación digital?],2019.0,Blockchain; Co-operative banking; Co-operative banks; Customer experience; Digital transformation; Digitization,"The digital transformation is posing an unprecedented challenge for the financial sector. The classic model of financial intermediation is threatened. This is both a consequence of the development and the application of new technologies that are transforming society and that are empowering individuals with new digital tools. Nowadays, banks are not only competing with each other. New actors have also emerged in the financial landscape, such as fintech (financial companies whose business model is technology-intensive) and techfin (technology companies offering financial services, especially large technology companies -or bigtech-). The extensive branch networks that are typical for traditional retail banking, such as in cooperative banks, are reducing their prominence in the face of the growing offer and digitized management of financial products and services. The credit cooperatives have traditionally been characterized by a special link with their base of members and customers based on physical proximity. This has allowed the acquisition of great knowledge of the economic activity within the territory where the cooperative banks are established. Digital transformation and non-face-to-face financial services can significantly affect this traditional relational model based on personal contact with the users. Consequently, faced with this paradigm shift and taking into account the particularities that define the cooperative banking model, there is an interest to analyse the perception of this sector on this important and accelerated technological change, both from the perspective of internal processes, as from the external perspective of its clients. At the same time, it is appropriate to inquire about whether this process is being perceived differently depending on the size of the cooperative bank, given the fact that the traditional model of cooperative banking has been based on a wide network of offices. This research would be, as far as it is known, the first to address such a task in the field of credit cooperatives, since the scarce studies found have a more general character about the banking sector as a whole. In order to comply with the proposed objectives, information has been obtained through a questionnaire, consisting of 20 questions of a quantitative and qualitative nature. The questionnaire has been answered by a large number of Spanish credit cooperatives (41 out of 62 existing cooperative banks). With the obtained answers, a statistical-descriptive analysis has been completed, through the application of common statistics, such as: arithmetic mean, standard deviation, percentiles, maximum and minimum. In turn, in line with the objectives set, statistics are presented including calculations for both, the sample set and for two sub-samples, in order to distinguish between entities of different dimensions. Once the analysis has been concluded, some remarkable results have been obtained. On the one hand, the cooperative banks that have been included in this study have indicated the necessity to improve their digital transformation. It can also be observed that the digital gap is perceived in relation to the rest of the banking sector. Managers are aware of the significant impact of the digital transformation of the economy and society. Technology-based tools, such as big data, may have the greatest impact on the commercial banking activity. Within the next five years an intense competition from technology- based companies is expected. Furthermore, the technological culture of members and customers is insufficient. On the other hand, it can also be observed that the dimension of the cooperative banks influences their perception of the digital transformation in the cooperative banking sector. In this sense, the cooperative banks that affirmed the existence of a wide margin of improvement in the operational scope have a smaller dimension and more seniority than the rest of the sample. Banks that have a higher number of total assets and a higher number of employees also perceive a greater margin of improvement when it comes to the internal management processes. Additionally, the results indicate that the perceptions of digital transformation are conditioned by the size of the entity. Larger entities perceive a lower degree of assimilation of the digital transformation by the organization's employees, giving it greater importance to the impact of different technologies. Large entities perceive less intensity of competition from foreign banks and value the degree of technological and financial culture of members and customers more. However, these results have limitations that have conditioned this research. These are basically founded on the fact that the analysis is based on the perceptions of the managers of the surveyed entities. This implies a degree of subjectivity conditioned by multiple non-controllable variables. With this general approach to different aspects related to digital transformation it has not been possible to contemplate other transcendental issues. The study culminates with a series of strategic suggestions that can be considered by the sector. Credit cooperatives, usually with a smaller comparative dimension with respect to the large commercial banks and based on federative models, cooperation or systems of cooperative concentration give special value to territorial self-identification and proximity to the members. Technology can be a factor of distancing that can lead to a loss of personal contact with members or clients. Therefore, the cooperative bank must design compatibility strategies between the philosophy of its specific business model and the assimilation of digital transformation. Precisely, its closeness to the client can be the way to acquire a prominent role in the financial-digital education process that society will demand over the next few years. Additionally, based on the results obtained, it can be said that, from a strategic approach, credit cooperatives must value or advance in various lines of digital transformation of their activity, both in their internal and organizational processes and in their relations with clients. In the latter case, the reduction of processing times for operations, the use of apps (mobile applications) and access systems that are increasingly simple, agile and attractive, can be essential. Special attention should be given to anything that implies a more satisfied customer experience and simplification of procedures, with a wider and more personalized portfolio of financial products and services. In this sense, the strategy should begin with evaluating the implementation of new technologies that already anticipate major changes. This is the case of blockchain in its internal processes or the use of vast amounts of data that is collected from the daily relationship with customers, with the aim of improving the personalization of the offer. © 2019 CIRIEC-España, Revista de Economía Pública, Social y Cooperativa.",Article,2-s2.0-85070382850

Its legal analysis is made amidst a context of radical changes in the European and French personal data protection law as well in the banking regulation, which is being transformed by the new payment services regulation. Methodology/approach/design - The article brings an interlacement of some new legal sources from the European and French law to appraise the limits of banking data protection. It tests the application of some legal norms in order to evaluate the potential protection in two areas: the security of the banking data on a new environment of payment services (fintechs and other new firms); the possibility of protection against the unauthorized data commercial usage. Findings - The article concludes that the European and French banking and payment services law have not the desired level of protection against bad commercial practices in a context, which is marked by both the retailers and payment services integration as well the presence of the big techs. The data protection law must complement the banking and payment services regulation in order to provide the desired level of protection. Practical implications - The article demonstrates the possibility of testing new kinds of legal regulation - data protection - to archive social and economic security in a different sector, like baking and commerce.Originality/value - The article departs from a new concept of banking data, built from the meshing of the concepts of banking information and sensible personal data. From this conceptual frame, it can evaluate the level of protection granted by the European and French law in order to sketch a possible protective regime. © 2019 Universidade de Brasilia.

We explore the sensitivity of the terminal wealth distribution to restricting the segment of the efficient frontier available to the investor. Since our algorithm’s optimal strategy can be on the efficient frontier and is driven by an investor’s wealth and goals, it soundly beats the performance of target date funds in attaining investors’ goals. These optimal goals-based wealth management strategies are useful for independent financial advisors to implement behavioral-based FinTech offerings and for robo-advisors. © 2019, Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85066972362
"Shaikh S., Zaka F.",Blockchained Sukuk-Financing,2019.0,Blockchain; Fintech; Islamic finance; Smart contract; Sukuk,"Sukuk have proven to be a significant innovation in the Islamic finance industry, introduced as an alternative to conventional bonds and securities. Aiming for fairer distribution of market risk between the haves and have-nots, Islamic finance focuses on funding the purchase of real assets rather than simply borrowing money. However, in reality, this requirement of “asset-backed” borrowing has limited the growth of the sukuk segment. We propose the application of blockchain technology to enhance the traceability of credit to the specific financed assets. Sukuk transactions can involve a number of parties, especially when sale, lease and agency contracts are combined. Some recent sukuk-default scandals transpired to have avoided “true sale” of underlying assets. Since the opinion of religious scholars can have a significant impact on the valuation of sukuk, we believe that the traceability of asset transfers will enhance sukuk credibility and valuation. Moreover, a smart contract infrastructure with blockchain security should also significantly reduce the execution time for such transactions. We present an initial model for blockchained sukuk-issue in this paper, highlighting the significant design features that specifically concern this niche market. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85066118594

This is not unusual for a new technology. On top of such cryptocurrencies, another new technology, so-called smart contracts, has been established. Smart contracts are specialized computer code with the aim to automate the exchange of (digital) assets. In decentralized applications (Ðapps), parts of the business logic and the data storage of traditional web applications are replaced with smart contracts. They are credited with considerable potential for commercial use, especially in FinTech but also beyond. Smart contracts mostly lack explicit legal regulation as well. Hitherto there is little experience in applying current law to them. Building a business on uncertain terrain is at least risky. We seek a clarification of smart contracts in the legal context, especially against the background of the Civil Code. © 2019 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85065654354

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will dramatically transform how we do transactions, just as the Internet revolutionized how we communicate. Currently, more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies are quoted on the market, and many more are being launched in initial coin offerings for use as an exchange method in a specific business ecosystem or as rights to assets or liabilities. As an emerging fintech, cryptocurrencies open up many opportunities, but they also pose significant challenges and limitations. This paper analyzes the key factors for the successful development of a cryptocurrency from a consumer-behavior perspective. Using a technology acceptance theoretical framework, we test a model able to explain almost 85% of the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, risk was not a significant factor. This could be because most of the respondents considered operating with cryptocurrencies to be risky; the lack of variability in their responses to the questions about perceived risk would explain this lack of explanatory power. However, willingness to manage cryptocurrency risk could be a precondition for adoption. The performance expectancy for a given cryptocurrency was the most important factor for its success. The research was conducted in Spain with college-educated adults with basic knowledge of the Internet. © 2019 Arias-Oliva, Pelegrín-Borondo and Matías-Clavero.",Article,2-s2.0-85065200851

Survey consists of 21 questions: 5 on demographic statistics, 10 on mobile payment service quality, 3 on purpose of mobile payment service usage, 3 onuser satisfaction as a mediating variable, using Likert’s 5-point-scale measurement. Positive analysis used SPSS 23.0 for element analysis, reliability analysis, correlation analysis, regression analysis to control for variables. Finding: The total variance for mobile payment service element measurement categories is 87.880% and the found eigenvalue is all above 1.0, and the factor score is above 0.5, meeting the reliability and validity of research. Regression analysis shows all independent variables affects the dependent variable. Mediating effects of three categories of mobile payment service on economic usage intention of using mobile payment service hold significant. The economics and security of the independent variable and its R2 value incrementally increased and significance probability was below 0.05. Therefore, we conclude that even if service quality is high, if user satisfaction is low, intention of using service decreases. So, we can state that customer satisfaction is important.

As these review systems are centralized, the trust is based on a single entity. The fairness of the system hinges on the honesty of the central controlling authority. This dependency can be avoided by decentralizing the source of the trust. Bitcoin has shown the power of decentralization and shared database through blockchain technology, and currently is being studied for its immense impact on FinTech. We leverage blockchain to address the above concern and present a decentralized manuscript review system that provides trust and fairness. We call this system MaRSChain.

Enterprises are keen on embracing the advantages of Blockchain in applications ranging from FinTech, Supply chain, IoT, Identity Management, Notary, Insurance and to many other domains. Blockchain is often spoken of as the third disruption after computers and the internet, and is being studied for application in several domains. A blockchain, as used in most cryptocurrencies, does not require any authorization for participants to join or leave the system, and hence is referred to as a permission-less blockchain. However, enterprise applications cannot operate in such models. Enterprise applications operate in a regulated, permissioned blockchain setting. This paper provides an industry focused insight into the practicality and feasibility of permissioned blockchains in real-world applications. In particular, we consolidate some non-trivial challenges that should be addressed in making the permissioned blockchain practically deployable in enterprises. © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85061582311

The latest development of digital services within the frame of a FinTech leaves out the product comparison so far and therefore a consumer has to rely on these online tools. Six comparison tools were found and analyzed in two selected countries. The information quality test was performed based on the EU methodology regarding accuracy and full price, relevance, language and concision, detail, uniformity, comparability, and verifiability. The user test profile is a retail mainstream client with e-banking preference. All comparison tools but one failed in the information quality test. Some of them provided a correct result for only 33% of compared offers. Most of the misguiding and incorrect results came from a miscalculation of specific conditional sales issues and ATM withdrawal from other bank’s network service. Only one comparison tool passed with the share of correct and plausible results above 90%. Unsatisfactory results can be explained by the incompleteness of CTs, not being up-to-date issues and by a specific pricing policy different from e.g. United Kingdom or Germany.

For this we use an experimental setting with repeated investment decisions over multiple trading days, and we also test a new form of risk simulation in which wealth paths over time are presented rather than just final outcomes. After investors’ initial decisions, for which we confirm previous findings, we do not find persistent differences of simulation-based learning on investors’ risk-taking behavior. With regards to trading volume, only a simulation in which investors see wealth paths and not only final outcomes leads to lower trading frequency soon after the initial asset allocation. © 2018",Article,2-s2.0-85056179670

Cryptocurrency exchanges, which act as the gateway to this world, now play a dominant role in the circulation of Bitcoin. Thus, delving into the analysis of the transaction patterns of exchanges can shed light on the evolution and trends in the Bitcoin market, and participants can gain hints for identifying credible exchanges as well. Not only Bitcoin practitioners but also researchers in the financial domains are interested in the business intelligence behind the curtain. However, the task of multiple exchanges exploration and comparisons has been limited owing to the lack of efficient tools. Previous methods of visualizing Bitcoin data have mainly concentrated on tracking suspicious transaction logs, but it is cumbersome to analyze exchanges and their relationships with existing tools and methods. In this paper, we present BitExTract, an interactive visual analytics system, which, to the best of our knowledge, is the first attempt to explore the evolutionary transaction patterns of Bitcoin exchanges from two perspectives, namely, exchange versus exchange and exchange versus client. In particular, BitExTract summarizes the evolution of the Bitcoin market by observing the transactions between exchanges over time via a massive sequence view. A node-link diagram with ego-centered views depicts the trading network of exchanges and their temporal transaction distribution. Moreover, BitExTract embeds multiple parallel bars on a timeline to examine and compare the evolution patterns of transactions between different exchanges.

The huge lending transaction data generated online helps to predict repayment of the borrowers, but there are limitations in extracting features based on the complex information. Convolutional neural networks (CNN) can automatically extract useful features from large P2P lending data. However, as deep CNN becomes more complex and deeper, the information about input vanishes and overfitting occurs. In this paper, we propose a deep dense convolutional networks (DenseNet) for default prediction in P2P social lending to automatically extract features and improve the performance. DenseNet ensures the flow of loan information through dense connectivity and automatically extracts discriminative features with convolution and pooling operations. We capture the complex features of lending data and reuse loan information to predict the repayment of the borrower. Experimental results show that the proposed method automatically extracts useful features from Lending Club data, avoids overfitting, and is effective in default prediction. In comparison with deep CNN and other machine learning methods, the proposed method has achieved the highest performance with 79.6%. We demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed method as the 5-fold cross-validation to evaluate the performance. © 2019, Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85048600530

Although financial institutions promote development, consumers have lost confidence in banks. As we enter the Fintech era, banks have the opportunity to use new tools that enable greater transparency for customers. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) plays a key role in increasing social awareness of regulators, society, shareholders, and employees—in short, stakeholders. This study therefore focuses on banks that have designed their activities and investments to contribute to sustainability. The principal contribution of this paper is to show the existence of a range of business models that arise following different responses by different types of banks. These different responses occur because the primary objective of sustainable banks is to meet the needs of stakeholders and contribute to sustainable development, whereas conventional banks simply apply and execute CSR policies. It is possible to differentiate between ethical banks and commercial banks. To ensure economic progress and achieve sustainability, it is fundamental to balance economic profitability with people’s social and environmental aspirations. © 2018, University of Finance and Management in Warsaw.

Interviews with public regulatory bodies, financial institutions and technology providers reveal a culture of compliance with increased transparency, surveillance and accountability. Findings show that dialectic tensions arise as the pursuit of transparency, surveillance and accountability in compliance mandates is simultaneously rationalized, facilitated and obscured by regulatory technology.

Bapat D.,Exploring advertising as an antecedent to brand experience dimensions: an experimental study,2018.0,Advertising; Brand experience; Experimental study,"The objective of the study is to investigate the impact of advertising on brand experience dimensions for an existing bank and a financial technology (Fintech) brand. A 2 × 2 between-subject experimental study was conducted that analyzed the antecedents of brand experience dimensions and compared them between an existing bank and a fintech brand. The study confirmed the main effect of advertising on all brand experience dimensions. The brand experience scores for the fintech brand were higher than that of the existing bank brand, and significant differences were observed for sensory, emotional, and behavioral brand experience dimensions. The study confirms the influence of advertising on both existing bank and fimtech brand. While most of the previous studies are based on survey research, the present study provides deep probing using experimental study. It seeks to understand the antecedent to brand experience in the context of an emerging country. © 2018, Springer Nature Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85055437581

If the forecast model is not a better one then it can cause liquidation and spoil the trust of customers in the market. Early predictions based on social media clients' opinion plays a major role in order to reduce risk on business and keep the trust of customer. According to the survey done by Fintech's world topic analysis is treated as one of the vital factor used for the determination of client's trends and for forecast analysis. Here we have performed a comparative analysis upon the social media data provide by Twitter in order to get an idea about the perception and understanding of clients' requirements across the world. For the experimentation purpose we have used Tweeter data for tweet analysis, for stock price we have yahoo finance data and for number of stocks we have used morning star data set. For the processing of Tweets given by the clients we have built an automated system using Deep Learning. Here the problem is divided in to 2 parts. In first part Text classification is done using Tensorflow and Keras, Latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK-NLP).In this part using topic analysis the past tweet history is analyzed. In second part we are predicting forecastto identify multiple key business factors using Long Short term Memory (LSTM) using python/Rto. The actual aim of the system is to discover the effect of 3 fundamental parameters like security breaches, innovation, and stock exchange which are present in tweet given by the customers.

One such piece of legislation is the revised Payment Services Directive (PSD2), which intends to further define a common legal framework for the payment market in the European Economic Area, with the aim of increasing the level of integration and efficiency in the market, as well as increasing the level of consumer protection. In this context, the enhancement of collaborative infrastructures can be the keystone to anticipate and transform the challenges of PSD2 into opportunities. This paper describes the creation of an open banking platform, called CBI Globe — Global Open Banking Ecosystem, to facilitate the interconnection between banks and third parties through application programming interfaces, in line with the new directive. Using this platform, adhering parties will be able to simplify and expedite the administration of current accounts by offering both reporting and payment and collection services, thus exploiting the business opportunities enabled by PSD2. © Henry Stewart Publications.",Article,2-s2.0-85064160511

Services traditionally offered by incumbents are now rapidly unbundled by a growing set of startups, leading to new models of collaboration and a significant shift in power. This study provides insight into the structure of the FinTech ecosystem using data-driven visualizations of 6,493 global companies across 24 market segments. We focus on two types of ecosystem entities, namely, (1) firms that create, offer, and acquire FinTech services and (2) investors that fund and enable them. Our analyses reveal a highly skewed global footprint of FinTech activities, differential growth patterns across ecosystem segments, highly interdependent network structure, and a variegated nature of investments and acquisitions led by key incumbents and venture capital firms.

We study how two forces, regulatory differences and technological advantages, contributed to this growth. Difference in difference tests exploiting geographical heterogeneity induced by four specific increases in regulatory burden–capital requirements, mortgage servicing rights, mortgage-related lawsuits, and the movement of supervision to Office of Comptroller and Currency following closure of the Office of Thrift Supervision–all reveal that traditional banks contracted in markets where they faced more regulatory constraints; shadow banks partially filled these gaps. Relative to other shadow banks, fintech lenders serve more creditworthy borrowers and are more active in the refinancing market. Fintech lenders charge a premium of 14–16 basis points and appear to provide convenience rather than cost savings to borrowers. They seem to use different information to set interest rates relative to other lenders. A quantitative model of mortgage lending suggests that regulation accounts for roughly 60% of shadow bank growth, while technology accounts for roughly 30%. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85053706737

The examples of innovative financial services in Russia, including online banking and accounting, new payments and transfers services, platforms for crowdfunding and peer-to-peer lending, blockchain initiatives, etc. are discussed. It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets. The Government directs the main efforts to initiatives related to regulation of cryptocurrencies circulation and to introduction of blockchain in regtech and cybersecurity.

"West J., Chu M., Crooks L., Bradley-Ho M.",Strategy war games: how business can outperform the competition,2018.0,Banc assurance; Brand loyalty; Financial market; Scenario analysis; Strategy development; Wargame,"Purpose: Business wargames represent an alternative approach to challenge organisations to uncover internal capabilities through competitive actions designed to counteract external threats and address strategic mismatches. Internal capabilities uncovered as a result of actions taken during a competitive wargame aims to replicate market conditions found in competitive industries. These outcomes are difficult to achieve using many popular strategy design methods. The purpose of this study is to examine the use of war game-style activities in formulating corporate strategy that incorporate the natural behaviors of the leadership team in creating strategic plans. Design/methodology/approach: Using a case study from the banc assurance industry, the authors review a wargame process composed of two competing teams; the banc assurance organisation and an unincorporated joint venture between a banking institution and an insurance company. The goal of each entity was to develop strategy to improve both customer satisfaction and market share at the expense of each other given a finite set of resources. Success was judged using a simple set of metrics defined by both a consumer team and an independent umpire. Findings: Consumers of financial services are price sensitive and highly brand loyal. Unwillingness to switch brands to a prevailing competitor or other emerging (Fintech) institution persists to a threshold of a price and/or value differential of 15 to 20 per cent. The results highlight potential deficiencies in the proposed banc assurance strategy through the observation of customer behaviours and inefficient resource use. Originality/value: The wargame approach conducted in a realistic landscape revealed internal capabilities not otherwise evident. The impact of authentic human behaviours in setting business strategy was captured which is very difficult to replicate using more formal scenario analysis and planning. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85055574221
"Yang D., Li M.",Evolutionary Approaches and the Construction of Technology-Driven Regulations,2018.0,fintech; regtech; technology-driven regulation,"Innovation technologies have substantially changed commerce and society. A new financial industry in the form of financial technology (fintech) initiated the era of the digital economy. At the same time, inherent risks in technology-driven financial innovations, such as technical risks, information asymmetry, and even potential systemic risks, necessitate regulatory responses. However, insufficient regulatory techniques, outdated financial laws, and conservative regulatory concepts make it difficult for traditional regulations based on financial intermediaries to adapt to the current environment of decentralized financial transactions. Technology-driven regulations focused on data monitoring could be a remedy for the inefficiency and ineffectiveness of traditional financial regulations and enhance effective protection of financial consumers’ rights and interests. This new regulatory model aims to build a system that integrates equal access to information on blockchain transactions by both parties to it (i.e., the regulators and the financial institutions they regulate) for the purpose of oversight, intelligent real-time oversight, and an experimental sandbox for developing regulatory technology. This dynamic and flexible financial regulatory system could effectively address fintech risks. ©, Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.",Article,2-s2.0-85051989439

Ironically, as cryptocurrencies reached collective valuations of hundreds of billions of dollars the Bitcoin project failed in its original purpose as an alternative currency governed by code rather than trust. Not only has Bitcoin not become a popular means of global peer-to-peer transactions but the much vaulted purity of algorithmic governance is heavily entangled in social relations. This article reviews blockchain's computer architectures, its connections to materiality and space and the complexity of its established practices. This analysis shows that rather than occupying an algorithmic place apart, blockchain contains multiple and conflicting agencies and is messily embedded in the code/space of materiality. Nevertheless the faith in the superiority of algorithmic governance has injected a powerful discourse in economies that has proven more important and disruptive than the actual practices of Bitcoin or blockchain. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85052895392

We further aim to offer various perspectives in order to aid the understanding of the disruptive potential of FinTech, and its implications for the wider financial ecosystem. By drawing upon very recent and highly topical research on this area this study examines the implications for financial institutions, and regulation especially when technology poses a challenge to the global banking and regulatory system. It is driven by a wide-ranging overview of the development, the current state, and possible future of fintech. This paper attempts to connect practitioner-led and academic research. While it draws on academic research, the perspective it takes is also practice-oriented. It relies on the current academic literature as well as insights from industry sources, action research and other publicly available commentaries. It also draws on professional practitioners’ roundtable discussions, and think-tanks in which the author has been an active participant. We attempt to interpret banking, and regulatory issues from a behavioural perspective. The last crisis exposed significant failures in regulation and supervision. It has made the Financial Market Law and Compliance a key topic on the current agenda. Disruptive technological change also seems to be important in investigating regulatory compliance followed by change. We contribute to the current literature review on financial and digital innovation by new entrants where this has also practical implications. We also provide for an updated review of the current regulatory issues addressing the contextual root causes of disruption within the financial services domain. The aim here is to assist market participants to improve effectiveness and collaboration. The difficulties arising from extensive regulation may suggest a more liberal and principled approach to financial regulation. Disruptive innovation has the potential for welfare outcomes for consumers, regulatory, and supervisory gains as well as reputational gains for the financial services industry. It becomes even more important as the financial services industry evolves. For example, the preparedness of the regulators to instil culture change and harmonise technological advancements with regulation could likely achieve many desired outcomes. Such results range from achieving an orderly market growth, further aiding systemic stability and restoring trust and confidence in the financial system. Our action-led research results have implications for both research and practice. These should be of interest to regulatory standard setters, investors, international organisations and other academics who are researching regulatory and competition issues, and their manifestation within the financial and social contexts. As a perspective on a social construct, this study appeals to regulators and law makers, entrepreneurs, and investors who participate in technology applied within the innovative financial services domain. It is also of interest to bankers who might consider FinTech and strategic partnerships as a prospective, future strategic direction.1 © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85050490838

We analyze how this feature affects asset price informativeness when investors can acquire signals of increasing precision over time about the payoff of an asset. As the cost of low precision signals declines, prices are more likely to reflect these signals before more precise signals become available. This effect can ultimately reduce price informativeness because it reduces the demand for more precise signals (e.g., fundamental analysis).

We find that the probability of an ICO's success is higher if the code source is available, when a token presale is organized, and when tokens allow contributors to access a specific service (or to share profits). Our results provide valuable insights into this new source of capital for businesses and into the key determinants of fundraising success. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85047101504
"Drasch B.J., Schweizer A., Urbach N.",Integrating the ‘Troublemakers’: A taxonomy for cooperation between banks and fintechs,2018.0,Banking; Cooperation; Digital transformation; Fintechs; Taxonomy,"The banking sector has been subject to fundamental changes as digitalization is enabling novel technology-driven banking services and is creating new customer demands. While banks face sluggish innovation processes, fintechs take advantage of the digital era, delivering customer-centric solutions. Although banks have realized that cooperation with fintechs is a key approach to foster innovation, they struggle to address the associated challenges. Yet, there has been very little research into this phenomenon, so as to establish best practices, because neither bank-fintech cooperation, nor associated and relevant characteristics have been evaluated. However, especially from an economic and financial perspective it is crucial to close this research gap to better understand how technology-driven organizations and cooperating with them reshapes the financial sector and therefore entire economies. Thus, we propose a theoretically founded and empirically proven taxonomy. Based on the literature, 136 real-world cases, and 12 expert interviews, our results suggest structuring and describing bank-fintech cooperation through 13 dimensions. Further, the empirical examination allows for the identification of prevailing cooperation patterns. Our findings contribute to theory development on fintechs, their integration into the banking sector, and the cross-organizational cooperation research area. This paper also has practical implications for both banks and fintechs, and opens promising avenues for future research. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85046162156

In this paper, we use account-level data from LendingClub and Y-14M data reported by U.S. banks with assets over $50 billion to examine whether the fintech lending platform could expand credit access to consumers. We find that LendingClub's consumer lending activities have penetrated areas that may be underserved by traditional banks, such as in highly concentrated markets and areas that have fewer bank branches per capita. We also find that the portion of LendingClub loans increases in areas where the local economy is not performing well. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.",Article,2-s2.0-85045214099
"Wang Q., Gu L., Xue M., Xu L., Niu W., Dou L., He L., Xie T.",FACTS: Automated black-box testing of fintech systems,2018.0,Automated test generation; Black-box testing; FinTech,"FinTech, short for ""financial technology,"" has advanced the process of transforming financial business from a traditional manualprocess- driven to an automation-driven model by providing various software platforms. However, the current FinTech-industry still heavily depends on manual testing, which becomes the bottleneck of FinTech industry development. To automate the testing process, we propose an approach of black-box testing for a Fin- Tech system with effective tool support for both test generation and test oracles. For test generation, we first extract input categories from business-logic specifications, and then mutate real data collected from system logs with values randomly picked from each extracted input category. For test oracles, we propose a new technique of priority differential testing where we evaluate execution results of system-test inputs on the system's head (i.e., latest) version in the version repository (1) against the last legacy version in the version repository (only when the executed test inputs are on new, not-yet-deployed services) and (2) against both the currently-deployed version and the last legacy version (only when the test inputs are on existing, deployed services). When we rank the behavior-inconsistency results for developers to inspect, for the latter case, we give the currently-deployed version as a higherpriority source of behavior to check. We apply our approach to the CSTP subsystem, one of the largest data processing and forwarding modules of the China Foreign Exchange Trade System (CFETS) platform, whose annual total transaction volume reaches 150 trillion US dollars. Extensive experimental results show that our approach can substantially boost the branch coverage by approximately 40%, and is also efficient to identify common faults in the FinTech system. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85058274340

However, our recent work discovered thousands of vulnerabilities in 693 banking apps, which indicates these apps are not as secure as we expected. This motivates us to conduct this study for understanding the current security status of them. First, we take 6 months to track the reporting and patching procedure of these vulnerabilities. Second, we audit 4 state-of-the-art vulnerability detection tools on those patched vulnerabilities. Third, we discuss with 7 banking entities via in-person or online meetings and conduct an online survey to gain more feedback from financial app developers. Through this study, we reveal that (1) people may have inconsistent understandings of the vulnerabilities and different criteria for rating severity; (2) state-of-the-art tools are not effective in detecting vulnerabilities that the banking entities most concern; and (3) more efforts should be endeavored in different aspects to secure banking apps. We believe our study can help bridge the existing gaps, and further motivate different parties, including banking entities, researchers and policy makers, to better tackle security issues altogether. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85058314973

However, deep learning (DL) on the application of automated financial management has been rarely investigated. Thus, this research focuses on the applications of FinTech and DL in asset allocation and aims to optimize investment portfolio. The best investment portfolio in index-based funds based on Taiwan's index-type security investment trust funds are the main investment targets. Time series models for DL, that is, long short-term memory, predict the increase of each investment target and find the best investment portfolio in combination with the relevant asset allocation theory. In this research, we use the Markowitz mean-variance and Black-Litterman models as our asset allocation models for robo-advisor. Results show that the Black-Litterman model has a better accumulated return performance than the Morkowitz model and outperforms other strategies. The Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) dialogue service adopts artificial intelligence markup language (AIML) and a generative model. The main contribution of this paper is that we have developed an integrated knowledge-based and generative-based models for AI conversational robo-advisor. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85057319854

During the investment planning stage, portfolio optimization plays a crucial role, especially for the medium and long-term investors, in determining the allocation weight of assets to achieve the balance between investors expectation return and risk tolerance. The literature on the topic of portfolio optimization has been offering plenty of theoretical and practical guidance for implementing the theory; however, there is a paucity of studies focusing on the applications which are designed for Robo-Advisors. In this research, we proposed a modular system and focused on integrating big data analysis, deep learning method and the Black-Litterman model to generate asset allocation weight. We developed a portfolio optimization module which takes the information from a variety of sources, such as stocks prices, investor profile and the other alternative data, and used them as input to calculate optimal weights of assets in the portfolio. The module we developed could be used as a sub-system for Robe-Advisors, which offers a customized optimal portfolio based on investors preference. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85057321844
"Namvar A., Naderpour M.",Handling uncertainty in social lending credit risk prediction with a Choquet fuzzy integral model,2018.0,Choquet fuzzy integral; Credit risk prediction; Fuzzy measure; Peer-to-peer lending,"As one of the main business models in the financial technology field, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending has disrupted traditional financial services by providing an online platform for lending money that has remarkably reduced financial costs. However, the inherent uncertainty in P2P loans can result in huge financial losses for P2P platforms. Therefore, accurate risk prediction is critical to the success of P2P lending platforms. Indeed, even a small improvement in credit risk prediction would be of benefit to P2P lending platforms. This paper proposes an innovative credit risk prediction framework that fuses base classifiers based on a Choquet fuzzy integral. Choquet integral fusion improves creditworthiness evaluations by synthesizing the prediction results of multiple classifiers and finding the largest consistency between outcomes among conflicting and consistent results. The proposed model was validated through experimental analysis on a real-world dataset from a well-known P2P lending marketplace. The empirical results indicate that the combination of multiple classifiers based on fuzzy Choquet integrals outperforms the best base classifiers used in credit risk prediction to date. In addition, the proposed methodology is superior to some conventional combination techniques. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85058028296

This is especially true of mobile payments, which are attracting increasing attention. However, the occurrence of many traditional financial mishaps has exposed the challenges inherent in online authentication technology that is based on traditional modes of realizing the healthy and stable development of mobile payment. In addition, this technology ensures user account security and privacy. In this paper, we propose a Secure Mutual Authentication Protocol (SMAP) based on the Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) protocol for mobile payment. To guarantee reliable service, we use an asymmetric cryptosystem for achieving mutual authentication between the server and client, which can resist fake servers and forged terminals. Compared to the modes currently used, the proposed protocol strengthens the security of user account information as well as individual privacy throughout the mobile-payment transaction process. Practical application has proven the security and convenience of the proposed protocol. © 2018 Tsinghua University Press.",Article,2-s2.0-85053674626

In this paper, we examine the determinants of the use of FinTech finance by businesses, with a particular focus on the ownership, governance, and business practices that may modify the relationships with conventional motivations for external finance. Using a comprehensive sample of Chinese hi-tech small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we find that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and family firms and financially constrained firms are respectively much less and much more likely to seek FinTech finance. In the Chinese context, we argue that part of this may be because of the relative ease with which SOE SMEs can access cheaper conventional finance through SOE banks. The quality of traditional relationship banking also affects the relative desirability of FinTech financing. As for family firms, we find that innovation, as exemplified by RD activity, effectively overrides any conventional reluctance to access external finance, suggesting the relative benefits of FinTech finance for innovative high-growth firms. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85056559269

The fundamentals of internal information include company financial statements, after-hours transaction information and other information; the technical facet analysis aspects include moving average and a variety of indicators. Also, external information includes Taiwan stock market related articles called chip facet analysis.In this paper, three facets were systematically analyzed to find the weights and calculate the fluctuation trend of individual stock, thereby more accurately predicting fluctuations in the following month. Also, this paper took Taiwan's financial stock as an example. The simulation-based period was from January to September 2017. The external information sources include: CNYES.com. and MoneyDJ. First, the initial weighted ratio of 8:2 for the internal and external information was found, and rolling learning was done to make adjustments and predict the monthly fluctuation from October to December 2017. Empirical results show that the accuracy of the traditional forecasting in predicting actual fluctuation trend is 62.25%. The internal information is the data reference of the fundamental and technical facets analysis. After coupled with the chip facet analysis was added and the three facets analyzed, the accuracy of the actual individual stock fluctuations obtained using weighted forecasting is 73.55%.

However, the outright ban on ICOs may hamper revolutionary technological developments and dampen the growth of this potentially beneficial market. In quest of a solution to meet the regulatory challenges rather than completely stifling the innovation, a comparative analysis has been conducted in some advanced economies, including the US, Canada, Australia, Singapore, Hong Kong, the UK and the EU in order to propose a regulatory framework for ICOs in China. After a thorough analysis of relevant experiences and regulatory measures in overseas jurisdictions, this paper provides a non-exhaustive classification of the legal status of ICOs, namely pre-sale of products or services, offering of shares, issue of debentures, issue of derivatives, collective investment schemes and crowdfunding, as well as a possible regulatory reform of the current ICO ban in China. It is then concluded that except for ICOs that can be regarded as pre-sale of products or services, the other five types of ICOs are highly likely to be considered as financial securities and thus should be subject to securities laws. © 2018, T.M.C.

What is the role of institutional factors on the international allocation of fintech venture capital? Research Findings/Insights: We document a notable change in the pattern of fintech venture capital (VC) investments around the world relative to other types of investments after the global financial crisis. We show that fintech venture capital investments are relatively more common in countries with weaker regulatory enforcement and without a major financial center after the financial crisis. Also, we show the fintech boom is more pronounced for smaller private limited partnership venture capitalists that likely have less experience with prior venture capital booms and busts. These fintech VC deals are substantially more likely to be liquidated, especially when located in countries without a major financial center. Theoretical/Academic Implications: We build on the institutions and corporate governance literatures by showing the importance of enforcement in driving relative differences in investment patterns and investor participation. For entrepreneurial startups, regulatory arbitrage drives investment into countries with a dearth of enforcement and regulatory costs. We argue that the spike in fintech venture capital in certain countries is attributable to differential enforcement of financial institution rules amongst startups versus large established financial institutions after the financial crisis. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Regulatory arbitrage in the context of fintech venture capital can spur booms and busts. Less experienced venture capitalists seem more prone to undertake investments that exacerbate boom and bust cycles. National governance is strengthened by the enforcement of regulatory standards, and corporate governance through investor experience and oversight can mitigate these swings, and facilitate better investment outcomes. © 2018 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Article,2-s2.0-85052931014
"Bollinger B., Yao S.",Risk transfer versus cost reduction on two-sided microfinance platforms,2018.0,Crowdfunding; FinTech; Lending; Microfinance; Pricing; Risk transfer; Two-sided platforms,"Microfinance can be an important tool for fighting global poverty by increasing access to loans and possibly lowering interest rates through microlending. However, the dominant mechanism used by online microfinance platforms, in which intermediaries administer loans, has profound implications for borrowers. Using an analytical model of microlending with intermediaries who disburse and service loans, we demonstrate that profit-maximizing intermediaries have an incentive to increase interest rates because much of the default risk is transferred to lenders. Borrower and lender interest rate elasticities can serve as disciplining mechanisms to mitigate this interest rate increase. Using data from Kiva.org, we find that interest rates do not affect lender decisions, which removes one of these disciplining mechanisms. Interest rates are high, around 38% on Kiva. In contrast, on an alternative microfinance platform that does not use intermediaries, Zidisha, interest rates are only around 10%, highlighting the dramatic impact of intermediaries on interest rates. We propose an alternative loan payback mechanism that still allows microfinance platforms to use intermediaries, while removing the incentive to increase interest rates due to the transfer of risk to lenders. © 2018, Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.",Article,2-s2.0-85046684854
"Marafie Z., Lin K.-J., Zhai Y., Li J.",Proactive fintech: Using intelligent IoT to deliver positive insurtech feedback,2018.0,Feedback; Fintech; InsurTech; UBI,"Financial Technology (FinTech) employs technological advancements and sharing economy models to improve financing services. The emergence of the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has changed the way humans interact with the surrounding world. In this paper, we present a proactive FinTech model that uses the IoT intelligence to deliver positive InsurTech feedback. We propose an InsurTech system with three main components: the monitoring and feedback device, the fog analytics engine, and the cloud server. The driving analytics use sensor-recorded data to calculate in real time the driving scores based on current driving patterns and road conditions. The feedback device then communicates with drivers providing helpful feedbacks and potential rewards. Given assertive recommendations offered by a system, the rational-economic model suggests that humans usually respond positively to cost minimizations and rewards maximizations. We have used real user data collected by the MapBar Auto Guard devices deployed in China to show an example of how IoT supports the implementation of the positive feedback paradigm. We believe our proactive FinTech model that speaks of actual costs and potential benefits in real time will offer an attractive service value and customer satisfaction. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85054086296

Eleven centres in eight countries are taken into consideration: New York, London, Frankfurt, Paris, Zurich/Geneva, Hong Kong/Shanghai/Beijing, Tokyo, and Singapore. The book addresses three main issues. The first is the hierarchy of international financial centres, in particular whether Asian financial centres have taken advantage of the crisis in the West. The second is the medium-term effects of the crisis, with respect to the volume of business activity (including employment), and the level of regulation, with concerns regarding the risks of regulatory overkill. And the third is the rise of new technology, known as fintech, possibly the most important change in the decade following the crisis, with questions as to whether it will render financial centres, as we know them, unnecessary for the functioning of the global economy, and which cities are likely to emerge as hubs of new financial technology. Finally, the book discusses the likely effects of Brexit on international financial centres, in particular London, Paris, and Frankfurt. The book takes a decidedly interdisciplinary approach, with a general introduction providing a global overview from a historical perspective, and a general conclusion providing a global overview from a geographical perspective. Its focus on the implications for global financial centres is unique among books about the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis. © Oxford University Press 2018.

Crowdfunding is part of this evolution and its use is becoming more widespread day by day. As more entrepreneurs and organizations seek crowdfunding to fund their ventures, and to solve the most important obstacle to achieve a successful crowdfunding campaign, which is not the information available about how to create a successful campaign, but rather its dispersion, it becomes of uttermost importance to create a framework to help them to succeed raising finance. It is, therefore, the main goal of this paper, to provide a valuable guide to help entrepreneurs in the hard task of raising finance through crowdfunding, mainly those using equity and reward crowdfunding. To accomplish the purposed goal, it is important to understand the underlying motivations of those investing in crowdfunding, in order to offer them what they seek and what motivates them. It is also essential to identify which kind of crowdfunding fits better the entrepreneur's goals and which one increases the likelihood of achieving them. Finally, is crucial to understand the specific success factors for a successful crowdfunding campaign. One of the main findings of this work, is that the motivations for investors in equity and reward crowdfunding are similar. This is very important, since it solves the problem of the scarcity of data for the equity model. With similar motivations it is possible to apply the data available for reward crowdfunding to equity crowdfunding, since both campaign can be design to answer the same needs and motivations. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85052500494
Wang J.,From aperture satellite to “Internet finance”: Institutionalization of ICTs in China's financial sector since 1991,2018.0,China; Fin-tech; ICT diffusion; Institutionalization; Internet finance,"China's financial industries started the process of marketization only two decades ago, but by 2017 its financial technology or fin-tech sector had taken half of the global market. The exponential diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Chinese financial contexts have generated new organizational structures and socio-political relations that have the capacity to change China's position in the world economy. Drawing upon the sociological concept of institutionalization, this paper examines how the Chinese state has integrated ICT diffusion in its formal policies and its informal rules in China's financial development since 1991. Further, it addresses the political and socio-economic consequences of these developments. Based on the analyses of government documents and sources, trade journals, and statistic data from business databases, this paper divides the Chinese institutionalization of financial technologies into three stages and identifies the primary actors and paradigms for ICT diffusions in each stage. ICT diffusion has been constitutive but also disruptive to the existing financial policies, instrumental to the commercialization of state-owned banks, and has gradually transformed into a set of formal and informal rules accepted by a network of professionals, corporations, and government agencies. The institutionalization of ICT diffusion has engendered the continuous adjustment of financial policies and propelled innovations in China's financial economy. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85046652611

Leveraging digital technologies to offer innovative services, FinTech start-ups are emerging in domains such as asset management, lending, or insurance. Despite increasing investments, the FinTech phenomenon is low on theoretical insights. So far, the offerings of FinTech start-ups have been predominantly investigated from a functional perspective. As a functional perspective does not suffice to fully understand the offerings of FinTech start-ups, we propose a taxonomy of non-functional characteristics. Thereby, we restrict our analysis to consumer-oriented FinTech start-ups. Our taxonomy includes 15 dimensions structured along the perspectives interaction, data, and monetization. We demonstrate the applicability of our taxonomy by classifying the offerings of 227 FinTech start-ups and by identifying archetypes via a cluster analysis.

I use within firm-time and lender-time tests that exploit lenders joining a credit bureau and sharing information in a staggered pattern. I find information sharing reduces relationship-switching costs, particularly for firms that are young, small, or have had no defaults. After sharing, lenders transition away from relationship contracting, in two ways: contract maturities in new relationships are shorter, and lenders are less willing to provide financing to their delinquent borrowers. My results highlight the mixed effects of transparency-improving financial technologies on credit availability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85044991324

We explore the hypothesis that big data disproportionately benefits big firms. Because they have more economic activity and a longer firm history, large firms have produced more data. As processor speed rises, abundant data attracts more financial analysis. Data analysis improves investors’ forecasts and reduces equity uncertainty, reducing the firm's cost of capital. When investors can process more data, large firm investment costs fall by more, enabling large firms to grow larger. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85049326924

To date, there is a lack of structured assessments of InsurTech. Prior research on FinTech fails (1) to clarify how InsurTech can be characterized and what capabilities are employed, and hence, (2) to reveal implications for value creation on firm and industry level. We address this by inductively building a model of InsurTech innovation adopting the grounded theory method. Our empirical data includes 208 InsurTech innovations from a market analysis based on Twitter data and a multiple-case study. The resulting model comprises 52 characteristics and 14 transformational capabilities and is integrated with extant value networks and intermediation literature. The former explains how InsurTech affects firm-level value creation and suggests that disruptive potentials emerge from aligning the transformational capabilities along three interdependent activities.

The participation of financial institutions in this ecosystem, although is rapidly improving, remains relatively low. This paper studies why some financial institutions choose to, or not to, participate in this nascent mobile payments ecosystem. We developed hypotheses for the influence of three factors as aspiration gaps, customer-facing IT capabilities, and institutional pressures based on three theoretical foundations including the threat rigidity thesis, capability-based view, and institutional theory. We then empirically tested our hypotheses by analyzing the diffusion of mobile payments among 3549 U.S. credit unions from 2013 to 2016.

The task of integrating such system is quite complicated, especially the integration of the financial technology system. In addition to being integrated, the flow of data and business processes must effectively reach every part which has interests in the process and the data. Business productivity can be achieved if the required data flows smoothly and is accessible as efficient as possible. Similarly, a bank which usually uses more than one information systems, when it need to combine financial statements from different bank systems must go through a data transformation mechanism to be accessible. Especially if the users of some bank accounts must access all their banking accounts at one time, of course, this would not be easy. As a response to those situations, in this research we proposed a financial technology application integration based on SOA (Service Oriented Architecture) which could be used to combine financials statements of all integrated banks every month.

This paper proposes solutions to assist law enforcement agencies in piecing together the disparate and complex technical, behavioural and criminological elements that make up cybercriminal offending. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review was conducted to highlight the main law enforcement challenges and discussions and examine current discourse in the areas of anonymity and attribution. The paper also looked at other research and projects that aim to identify illicit transactions involving cryptocurrencies and the darknet. Findings: An optimal solution would be one which has a predictive capability and a machine learning architecture which automatically collects and analyses data from the Bitcoin blockchain and other external data sources and applies search criteria matching, indexing and clustering to identify suspicious behaviours. The implementation of a machine learning architecture would help improve results over time and would be less manpower intensive. Cyber investigators would also receive intelligence in a format and language that they understand and it would allow for intelligence-led and predictive policing rather than reactive policing. The optimal solution would be one which allows for intelligence-led, predictive policing and enables and encourages information sharing between multiple stakeholders from the law enforcement, financial intelligence units, cyber security organisations and fintech industry. This would enable the creation of red flags and behaviour models and the provision of up-to-date intelligence on the threat landscape to form a viable intelligence product for law enforcement agencies so that they can more easily get to the who, what, when and where. Originality/value: The development of a functional software architecture that, in theory, could be used to detected suspicious illicit transactions on the Bitcoin network. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85064218694

To meet this target, the government will rely on technology to effectively scale services, monitor quality, and ensure accountability. While India has seen great strides in informational technology development and outsourcing, cellular phone penetration, cloud computing, and financial technology, the digital health ecosystem is in its nascent stages and has been waiting for a catalyst to seed the system. This National Health Protection Scheme is expected to provide just this impetus for widespread adoption. However, health data in India are mostly not digitized. In the few instances that they are, the data are not standardized, not interoperable, and not readily accessible to clinicians, researchers, or policymakers. While such barriers to easy health information exchange are hardly unique to India, the greenfield nature of India’s digital health infrastructure presents an excellent opportunity to avoid the pitfalls of complex, restrictive, digital health systems that have evolved elsewhere. We propose here a federated, patient-centric, application programming interface (API)–enabled health information ecosystem that leverages India’s near-universal mobile phone penetration, universal availability of unique ID systems, and evolving privacy and data protection laws. It builds on global best practices and promotes the adoption of human-centered design principles, data minimization, and open standard APIs.

Recent years have seen a remarkable trend for companies in all business sectors and industries to try to improve and extend the lifetime of their existing businesses and services by introducing the newest technologies. There is a requirement for FinTech or IoT to be integrated into the society in order to move beyond this goal, and to create new business models or services that are not descended from their existing business fields or services itself. While some simply maintain existing business areas that lack potential for company development, several companies find it difficult to develop business through advanced concepts, because they are bound by their existing capabilities. Thus, there is a need to find ways to create the business models and services that surpass vested interests, are sustainable, and which fulfil the demands of the society. Products and services using technology have been in demand through the years, and occasionally, they can actually threaten the survival of existing businesses; this clearly demonstrates that such products and services are truly indispensable for social creation. This paper aims to discuss the conceptualization of approaches necessary to create such products and services, and to provide ideas for new services by introducing examples. © 2018",Review,2-s2.0-85048943093
Iman N.,Is mobile payment still relevant in the fintech era?,2018.0,Case study methods; Developing countries; Financial services; Financial transactions; Fintech; Innovation; Mobile payment; Modularity; Networks; Payment networks; Platforms; Technology ecosystems,"Mobile phones have provided such an enormous opportunity for financial development, and are anticipated to become a common tool for carrying out various financial transactions. Hundreds of mobile payment services have been introduced across the globe. Strikingly, many of these efforts have failed. This study analyzes whether mobile payment is still relevant in the fintech era. I compare three mobile payment projects – Oi Paggo in Brazil, TCASH in Indonesia, and M-PESA in Kenya – as case studies. I argue that mobile payment systems currently operate in such complex and multidimensional networks with shared common infrastructures and compete for producing and providing value to the customers on the basis of these infrastructures. Three attributes of industry and network structure are immediately of interest: (1) cutting the vertical supply chain more finely may encourage large players to extend their domination, (2) the basic platform continues to be governed by multinational operators (MNOs) – telecom firms, and (3) openness may be decreasing or increasing even as the number of independent parties in the supply chain drops. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-85047612385

This chapter reviews the major issues related with low-carbon finance of banks. First, low-carbon finance products of banks are diverse and are categorized into two areas: the retail banking sector as well as corporate and investment banking sectors. Many innovative financial product provided by banks are to introduced in ASEAN context. Second, government can provide several incentives to the private financial sectors. An example of public-private partnership is green certification in Republic of Korea. The leading role of governments is critical. Third, the careful recognition of environment risk for the target projects, banks can provide capital and management incentive to projects with low environment risks effectively. Fourth, in October 2015, UNEP FI released the Positive Impact Menifesto, which calls for a new financing paradigm to bridge the funding gap for sustainable development. Fifth, financial technology or 'fintech' is emerging as a core disruptor of every aspect of today's financial system. UN Environment commissioned an initial landscape review of the potential for fintech to advance sustainable development. Next, the situation of bank finance for low-carbon transition in Republic of Korea was studied in two ways: summarizing the situation of Korean banks during last three governments from 2008 to 2017 and interviewing a Korean expert in low-carbon finance. Based on the theoretical issues and case study of Republic of Korea, the policy recommendations were made for banks in ASEAN countries in four areas: recognition of 'low-carbon' as a new paradigm, leading role of the governments, global linkage of individual banks, and leapfrog by cutting-edge technology. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85053367611

Recent joint collaborations between banks and mobile-network operators leverage a customer’s past mobile phone transactions in order to create a credit score for the individual. In this work, we address the problem of launching a mobile-phone based credit scoring system in a new market without the marginal distribution of features of borrowers in the new market. This challenge rules out traditional transfer learning approaches such as a direct covariate shift. We apply a market-based re-weighting scheme of Original Market Borrowers that accounts for the differences in the original and new markets. The goal of applying this generalized covariate shift to three populations is to understand the repayment behavior of a fourth: New Market Borrowers who will self-select into a loan product when it becomes available. To test the approach we use real-world data sets from two Sub-Saharan countries in Africa consisting of 200,000 customers’ telephone records. Our results demonstrate that the market-based re-weighting scheme improves the credit scoring model in the new market compared to other more direct methods. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85050454280

However, the era of lightweight innovation and limited advancements in payments technology is coming to an end. The revised Payments Services Directive (PSD2) gives third parties the opportunity to develop, launch and become the preferred payments channel in regions where no alternative exists. Increasing smartphone adoption and internet access will see mobile become the dominant channel for everyday purchases. As payments are commoditised, the value of this channel is no longer limited to transaction fees. Instead, it is derived from user volume and data.Tech giants, such as Facebook, Google and Apple, recognise that data equal power and have made evidential steps toward becoming payment powerhouses. Banks bring formidable strengths to the payments arena. There are considerable benefits and revenue sources available to those that mobilise their long-term payment channels. Partnering with FinTechs allows banks to quickly become agile and launch cost-efficient minimum viable products and to test new ideas. To retain relevance in payments post-PSD2, banks must make mobile payments their top priority. © Henry Stewart Publications, 1750-1806.",Article,2-s2.0-85059057136

However, these types of crowdfunding have, for the most part, remained a phenomenon of those larger Member States that ‘draw a crowd’, with populations that are large enough to make crowdfunding systems economically feasible. In turn, crowdfunding has remained a mainly national issue, prompting the European Commission to conclude that there is no need for harmonization of crowdfunding rules in Europe. In contrast to the European Commission’s Capital Market Action Plan, this paper takes the view that national limitations on crowdinvesting and crowdlending de facto are the result of limits de iure. Given that no European passport is tailor made or fits crowdfunding, this source of financing is doomed to remain national. Moreover, with different legal requirements in Member States, European law hinders the development of cross-border crowdfunding within the region. This is particularly true for smaller Member States whose populations are too small to constitute ‘a crowd’. This paper details how European regulators could facilitate a Single European Crowdfunding Market. Regulation of the crowdfunding platform based on the ‘MiFID light’ framework could function as the basis for a cross-border crowdfunding manager passport, given the minimum protection it affords both investors and the financial system, and the low costs it imposes on the platform. Following the (1) too-small-to-care, (2) too-large-to-ignore, and (3) too-big-to-fail development path of FinTech business models, we suggest adding a relevance threshold of EUR250,000 in transaction volume to the MiFID light framework and imposing regulation to address systemic risk stemming from very large crowdfunding platforms. © 2018, T.M.C.

While most people focus only at cryptocurrencies; in fact, many administrative operations, fintech procedures, and everyday services that can only be done offline and/or in person, can now safely be moved to the Internet as online services. What makes it a powerful tool for digitalizing everyday services is the introduction of smart contracts, as in the Ethereum platform. Smart contracts are meaningful pieces of codes, to be integrated in the blockchain and executed as scheduled in every step of blockchain updates. E-voting on the other hand, is another trending, yet critical, topic related to the online services. The blockchain with the smart contracts, emerges as a good candidate to use in developments of safer, cheaper, more secure, more transparent, and easier-to-use e-voting systems. Ethereum and its network is one of the most suitable ones, due to its consistency, widespread use, and provision of smart contracts logic. An e-voting system must be secure, as it should not allow duplicated votes and be fully transparent, while protecting the privacy of the attendees. In this work, we have implemented and tested a sample e-voting application as a smart contract for the Ethereum network using the Ethereum wallets and the Solidity language. Android platform is also considered to allow voting for people who do not have an Ethereum wallet. After an election is held, eventually, the Ethereum blockchain will hold the records of ballots and votes. Users can submit their votes via an Android device or directly from their Ethereum wallets, and these transaction requests are handled with the consensus of every single Ethereum node. This consensus creates a transparent environment for e-voting. In addition to a broad discussion about reliability and efficiency of the blockchain-based e-voting systems, our application and its test results are presented in this paper, too. © 2018 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85050969775

To accompany the development and advancement of new means of access and service, the banks have sought the adoption of friendly and efficient digital platforms so that they can contain the advances of fintechs. Given this situation, the study aims to identify how fintechs are characterized as opportunities and threats for large financial institutions in Brazil. In order to understand and analyze the aspects related to fintechs, the research approaches topics that are aligned to the theme, such as the current context of the economy, the National Financial System and the scenario of start-ups in Brazil. This study has a descriptive and qualitative character, in which the data were collected from interviews with those responsible for financial institutions. The research allowed to identify that there is the acceptance by the great institutions to apply this fintechs model. It was also observed that there is a need to regulate the sector so that it can grow with more freedom and thus be able to add to the country this technological wealth, but it analyzes the need to be less bureaucratic like the financial institutions that operate in the market. The study presented the limitations of a few cases, in which it was not possible to interview more management in others companies which are involved in some way with the innovations of the organization. From this situation, it is suggested that other studies are carried out in order to cover other interesting points that concern the fintechs business model. The study allowed us to understand how large companies already established in the financial market identify fintechs and their business models. Identifying opportunities, threats and how this understanding permits the fintechs to prepare for a competitive market, and for large companies to understand how this model can be characterized as an ally.

But what do these developments signal for feminist engagements with the money economy? The transparency and pseudonymity that the blockchain provides has been welcomed as a ‘feminist weapon’. But the decentralised technology also legitimises many longstanding assumptions of libertarianism, especially competitive individualism, naturalised social inequality and the stability of value associated with the gold standard. Drawing on popular culture texts, Goldfinger and The Mandibles, this article considers this history, examining the gendered, racialised and sexualised discursive practices that attend representations of gold along with the ‘metallism’ surrounding blockchain-based cryptocurrencies in the contemporary conjuncture. By claiming to represent non-negotiable certainty derived from technology/nature rather than social convention, the fantasy of fundamental value returns, together with related associations of essentialism and authenticity, but anchored in this new context in the technocratic authoritarianism of FinTech. This is part of the background for the ‘new libertarianism’ whose ascendency now overshadows the neoliberalism that has been the focus of critical attention for some decades. © 2018, © 2018 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85054190547

Numerous benefits of utilizing cloud services are enhancing the efficiency of improving or creating new businesses. This trend is also associated with the rapid growth of the wireless networks, such as 5G. However, the great increase of deploying clouds also leads to new concerns in data security. One of the major concerns is private leakage that derives from insiders' malicious operations or attacks. This problem has raised a great restriction for financial firms to execute cloud applications. Focusing on this issue, we propose a new solution, entitled Privacy-Preserving Smart Storage (PS2) model that targets at solving the privacy leakage problems within the existing threat models. The proposed approach uses a novel distributed data storage method to prevent financial enterprises from insiders' massive data mining-based attacks.

Forelle M.C.,‘Then you are making riskless money’: a critical discourse analysis of credit default swap coverage in the financial trade press,2018.0,Credit default swap; critical discourse analysis; cultural studies; cultural studies of finance; finance,"Recently, scholars begun to urge an approach to the study of finance that interrogates the accepted wisdom of financial models and practices by examining the forces of power behind their development. Drawing from the field of cultural studies, Hardin and Rottinghaus (in their 2015 article, “Introducing a cultural approach to technology in financial markets”) advocate for a cultural studies of finance, which emphasizes the critical consideration of the co-constructive nature of financial technologies and cultures. This paper builds off that provocation using the concept of ‘rhetorical closure’ (as described by Pinch and Bijker in 2012) to explore how industry media aimed at derivatives developers, traders, and investment bankers worked to define the meanings of new financial technologies. Using critical discourse analysis, this study examines how credit default swaps (CDSs) were presented in the financial industry media in the years 1995–2007, and how this framing contributed to the politics of these artifacts. It finds that the financial industry media produced a discourse about CDSs using multiple overlapping frames that overgeneralized the success of CDSs from narrowly specific evidence and applied constant competitive pressure to adopt new financial technologies. These discourses implicitly encouraged the rapid adoption and broad application of CDSs, thus helping to (re)produce a financial culture in which self-interest and short-term gains were prioritized. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85039556862

This article starts with a discussion of the original ‘crisis of modernity’ discourses (avant la lettre), in which the clashing arguments of Comte and Tocqueville are featured, and a discussion of a second ‘crisis of modernity’ that developed in the context of the ‘Great Depression.’ A third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse emerged in the wake of the financial crises of the 1970s. Such crises are still ongoing and discussed within the boundaries of the third ‘crisis of modernity’ discourse.

(2014) in the context of portfolio analysis with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This reflection leads to define the financial production process as the generation of a distribution of returns by an initial investment. The main contribution of the paper is therefore to consider risks of various orders – mean return, variance of returns, and moments of higher order – as output variables and propose a set of axioms accordingly to supplement the definition of ‘financial’ technology set. In particular, this revisited set of axioms offers the advantage of allowing a generalization to multi-moment frameworks, and the resulting portfolio possibility set allows taking into account preferences for increases in risk that have remained ignored in applied studies with DEA although discussed in economic theory. We provide illustrations to show the effects of this contribution on the measures of technical efficiency and ranking of portfolios on a sample set of US common stocks; it shows how the proposed adjustments result in providing rankings that are more consistent with standard risk-return ratios in finance. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd",Article,2-s2.0-85016551075

Zeilinger M.,Digital Art as ‘Monetised Graphics’: Enforcing Intellectual Property on the Blockchain,2018.0,Art market; Blockchain; Copyright; Digital art; Digital rights management; Financialisation; Intellectual property; Monegraph,"In a global economic landscape of hyper-commodification and financialisation, efforts to assimilate digital art into the high-stakes commercial art market have so far been rather unsuccessful, presumably because digital artworks cannot easily assume the status of precious object worthy of collection. This essay explores the use of blockchain technologies in attempts to create proprietary digital art markets in which uncommodifiable digital artworks are financialised as artificially scarce commodities. Using the decentralisation techniques and distributed database protocols underlying current cryptocurrency technologies, such efforts, exemplified here by the platform Monegraph, tend to be presented as concerns with the interest of digital artists and with shifting ontologies of the contemporary work of art. I challenge this characterisation, and argue, in a discussion that combines aesthetic theory, legal and philosophical theories of intellectual property, rhetorical analysis and research in the political economy of new media, that the formation of proprietary digital art markets by emerging commercial platforms such as Monegraph constitutes a worrisome amplification of long-established, on-going efforts to fence in creative expression as private property. As I argue, the combination of blockchain-based protocols with established ambitions of intellectual property policy yields hybrid conceptual-computational financial technologies (such as self-enforcing smart contracts attached to digital artefacts) that are unlikely to empower artists but which serve to financialise digital creative practices as a whole, curtailing the critical potential of the digital as an inherently dynamic and potentially uncommodifiable mode of production and artistic expression. © 2016, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85043338162

Customers are also changing their behaviour with the evolving market environment and launch of new financial products and applications. In parallel, the technology scene and IT capabilities have advanced significantly, providing opportunities to create tools that can enhance the way risk is measured and managed. In this new and highly dynamic environment, how can banks best manage risk? A complex challenge is present with numerous paths and buzzwords such as Blockchain, machine learning and robotic process automation (RPA) to navigate. The industry, including the risk management function, needs to embrace the technical environment and recognise both its potential and its limitations. Technology enhancements benefit from a holistic view, combining subject matter expertise across multiple areas. Even the smartest cognitive system requires oversight to ensure relevance of data and the patterns observed to make business decisions. Market movements and concentrations may be ascribed to artificial intelligence and machine learning models going forward, and risk managers need to be able to navigate this space and manage the underlying risk factors.

This is a consequence of the simultaneous emergence of three key factors, namely deep penetration of internet, large supply of funds and unmet financial needs. The market exhibits several distinctive features in terms of the size of platforms, the level of market concentration and business models. As online lending gathers moment in China, many problems have come into light. China has recently established a relatively complete regulatory regime for online lending, introducing a number of significant changes, such as the restriction on the business model that can be adopted by platforms, registration requirements, custodian requirements, information disclosure requirements and lending limits. The new regime will have far-reaching implications, including a reshuffling of the market and more collaboration between online lending platforms and traditional banks. A comparative analysis of the Chinese experience with those in other jurisdictions such as the US, the UK, Hong Kong and Japan is conducted to examine the extent to which the new regime is likely to achieve a proper balance between its two main objectives, namely facilitating the growth of the online lending market and protecting financial consumers. While the new regime is generally sound, its efficacy will ultimately depend on how it is enforced in practice. © 2018, T.M.C. Asser Press.",Article,2-s2.0-85042640199

User payment data offer a good dataset to depict customer behavior patterns. A comprehensive understanding of customers' purchase behavior is crucial to developing good marketing strategies, which may trigger much greater purchase amounts. For example, by exploring customer behavior patterns, given a target store, a set of potential customers is able to be identified. In other words, personalized campaigns at the right time and in the right place can be treated as the last stage of consumption. Here we propose a probability graphical model that exploits the payment data to discover customer purchase behavior in the spatial, temporal, payment amount and product category aspects, named STPC-PGM. As a result, the mobility behavior of an individual user could be predicted with a probabilistic graphical model that accounts for all aspects of each customer's relationship with the payment platform. To achieve real time advertising, we then develop an online framework that efficiently computes the prediction results. Our experiment results show that STPC-PGM is effective in discovering customers' profiling features, and outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in purchase behavior prediction. In addition, the prediction results are being deployed in the marketing of real-world credit card users, and have presented a significant growth in the advertising conversion rate. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85046894220

"Liu X., Huang F., Yeung H.",The regulation of illegal fundraising in China,2018.0,China; criminal law; financial markets; financial regulation; illegal fundraising,"The rise of financial technology means that it is easier than ever to raise funds from a large group of people, notably via peer-to-peer lending or crowdfunding platforms. This article seeks to discuss the law on illegal fundraising, which has existed for some time before the boom of the Internet, as a legal response to the increasing number of fundraising from the public. Regulation is necessary to ensure market order and investor protection. Virtually in all markets, there are restrictions on how entities can make a public offer of shares, bonds and/or other investment schemes. There are several laws, most notably criminal law, in China that are relevant to illegal fundraising. An individual/company can potentially breach one or more of these rules as long as they attempt to raise funds from a non-conventional (i.e. not stock markets or banks) route. The worst outcome of this used to be death penalty. There has been a degree of ambiguities in the application of these laws. The article will attempt to clarify these ambiguities. The regulation of illegal fundraising can have a far reaching consequence on the financial markets in China, considering that non-state entities, particularly small and medium-sized enterprises, have limited access to conventional finance. The article will consider whether China is on the right track in terms of regulation to allow alternative fundraising channels to thrive. This article is the first ever to present a holistic account of the regulation of illegal fundraising in China. © 2018, © 2018 School of Law, City University of Hong Kong.",Article,2-s2.0-85054577773

As a result, usual functional relationships cease to operate, new institutes and interdependencies appear, and systemic risks increase. In this context, the system instability increases, resulting in a transition to a new institutional status. The analysis of the financial technologies impact on the stability of financial system shows that the lack of institutional support for new financial technologies is the most important catalyst for the financial industry destabilization and the formation of financial bubbles in various market segments. The ways to reduce the negative impact of financial technologies on the financial system stability (such as development of international prudential standards; revision of the licensing regime for financial companies; “regulatory sandboxes”, which test new technologies, business models and algorithms underlying the Fintech innovations; legal regulation of ownership of digital tokens; and clear definition of the blockchain technology in various areas of life, etc.) have been proposed. © The author(s) 2019.",Article,2-s2.0-85063180055

New financial technologies have already attracted many investors and form millions of budgets. Changing the traditional financial services concept, FinTech companies formed a new niche within the financial services market, the dynamic development of which determines the relevance of the development and implementation of an effective regulatory and oversight system. The purpose of the article is to develop an economic and mathematical model for forecasting the development of the FinTech market on the example of Ukraine. In order to study the development of the FinTech industry, a multiple regression model was presented. The model describes the dependence of the total investment value of FinTech from venture investments in financial technology, venture investments in other technologies and venture investments in online lending. Based on this model, the effect of attracting investments with new FinTech projects on the total volume of investments in the industry was clarified. According to the model, with a change in investments in FinTech by 1%, the total rate of venture investments decreases by 0.03, funds in new projects of other companies grow by 0.05, and venture investments in online lending increase by 0.89. According to the analysis of regulatory legislation in the foreign countries of the FinTech services sphere, it was found that the regulation of most of the risks associated with the development of FinTech services falls within the competence of different supervisory authorities, requiring cross-sectoral cooperation between public institutions. © Limited Liability Company",Review,2-s2.0-85061932050

In order to enhance the market efficiency and liquidity, the Stock Exchange of Thailand (SET) has granted Thai stock brokers permission to develop and offer their customers algorithm and automatic stock trading. However, algorithm trading on SET was not widely adopted. This chapter intends to design and empirically estimate a model in explaining Thai investors’ acceptance of algorithm trading. The theoretical framework is based on the theory of reasoned action and technology acceptance model (TAM). A sample of 400 investors who have used online stock trading and 300 investors who have used algorithm stock trading were observed and analyzed using structural equations model (SEM) and generalized linear regression model (GLM) with a Logit specification. The results confirm that attitudes, subjective norm, perceived risks, and trust toward algorithm stock trading are factors determining investors’ behavior and acceptance of using algorithm stock trading. Investor’s perception and trust on algorithm stock trading as a trading strategy is a major factor in determining their perceived behavior and control, which affect their decision on whether to invest using algorithm trading. Accordingly, it can be concluded that Thai investors is willing to accept algorithm trading as a new financial technology, but still has concern about the reliability and profitable of this new stock trading strategy. Therefore, algorithm trading can be promoted by building inves-tors’ trust on algorithm trading as a reliable and profitable trading strategy. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited.

We propose a methodology to improve the predictive performance of credit scoring models used by these applications. Our approach is composed of several steps, where we mostly focus on engineering appropriate features from the user data. Thereby, we construct pseudo-social networks to identify similar people and combine complex network analysis with representation learning. Subsequently we build credit scoring models using advanced machine learning techniques with the goal of obtaining the most accurate credit scores, while also taking into consideration ethical and privacy regulations to avoid unfair discrimination.

Part of the disadvantaged and low-income segments of global population is left without (i.e. financially excluded) or very limited access (i.e. financially underserved) to basic financial services, creating a highly critical equality deficit in different parts of the world. In this frame of reference, financial exclusion still remains a highly critical problem that hinders developing regions around the world from eradicating poverty leading to large-scale starvation and civil unrest. Moreover, financial exclusion is interwoven with social dependency making financially excluded/underserved populations strongly dependable on their social networks. The emergence of FinTech, the new breed between financial innovation and financial technology, which has been challenging the prevailing position of incumbent financial institutions, is providing a promising vehicle of tackling this phenomenon by closing the gap between unbanked, under-banked and developed societies, opening the door to the global digital economy, bringing a long-term societal transformational change for the financially excluded/underserved, while leading to inclusive economic growth helping move towards a more just and equitable society. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Mobile money has provided bank-like facilities, to the unbanked communities through its low cost of operation and widespread agent network. Regulatory response and support is essential for this advancement where it necessitates significant changes to the current regulatory practices. This task has been found to be difficult for regulators due to their limited technical knowledge in the field and resources. This paper posits the need for collaborative regulatory development which can provide solutions for multifaceted regulatory needs. It identifies how regulators and industry could work collaboratively to develop prudent regulation. Novel practical aspects, practiced among telecommunication firms and regulators, will be used for extending economic regulatory theories. © PACIS 2018.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85089223442
"Silic M., Ruf C.",The effects of the elaboration likelihood model on initial trust formation in financial advisory services,2018.0,Elaboration likelihood model; Financial advisory services; Initial trust; Mobile banking; Private banking,"Purpose: In order for financial institutions to cope with increased competitive pressure from the financial technology companies, offering digital services such as a mobile service system (MSS) targeted for high net worth individuals (HNWIs) becomes critical. Despite long-term trustworthy relationships between HNWIs and financial advisors, studies suggest that the formation of initial trust poses a significant challenge. The purpose of this paper is to identify various features related to initial trust antecedents. Design/methodology/approach: The study was conducted using the survey data, and employs variance-based structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques to test hypotheses. Findings: The findings from a closed experiment with 107 participants suggest that compared to more traditional service systems, customers are more prone to the construct of service quality, and specifically professional, prompt, dependable and timely financial advice. Originality/value: The study validated key constructs that positively influence the initial trust formation process and ultimately the intention to use in an MSS for the financial advisory. The authorts particularly emphasized the rebalancing and monitoring steps in the financial planning process between HNWIs and client advisors. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85046442375

As this technology has evolved very recently beyond the financial market, gaining more public attention, other promising blockchain applications areas and use cases are emerging. However, it is still not a straightforward in which application areas and use cases blockchains do provide an advantage beyond distributed databases and decentralized systems. Through a decentralized and immutable data storage blockchains enable the enforcement and verification of exchange assets, while disrupting potentially existing business models by promoting the disintermediation of processes involving multiple stakeholders. While having no mediator or a third party controlling the operation, less operational costs and a higher business agility are targeted at. However, the adoption of blockchains requires not only overcoming its technical challenges, but it also implies to reach the ability to understand and handle the impact on existing business models, processes, and legal compliances.

The paper identifies disruptive challenges for financial institutions need to adapt. The research investigates the value and the investment flows structure as most obvious indicators of FinTech and describes types of payments relationships there. The paper considers relationships between enterprises, financial institutions and individuals, which are formed in digital payments. To understand the difference between regular cross-border money transfers and P2P crossborder money transfers with TransferWise, both mechanisms were researched and the benefits underlined. For Ukraine, the improvement of existing cross-border payments system with FinTech is a crucial challenge. That is why it is important to focus on providing knowledge for people, supporting start-ups in the sector and learning the best implementation practices. A great example of cross-border payments of FinTech in Ukraine is TransferWise. The difference between regular cross-border money transfers and peer-to-peer (P2P) money transfers appears in its benefits, such as lower and more expectable transfer fee, mid-market exchange rate, less transaction period.

The disruption is in the form of loan distribution and profits gained by incumbent firms' business. This study is a pioneer study investigating the impact of fintech startups on incumbent firms' performance. Incumbent firms involved in this study are rural bank, commercial bank, and multi-finance institutions which principally run peer-to-peer lending business. Loan distribution was assessed by employing net loan to assets while profit was assessed by employing return on assets. This study was conducted in Indonesia by involving all incumbent firms registered in Indonesia Stock Exchange and Financial Service Authority. This study employed paired sample t-test to examine if net loans to assets and return on assets received differences before and after fintech startup emerged. The study reveals that fintech startup disrupts incumbent firms' business because incumbent firms' total of net loans to assets and total of return on assets decrease. However, this condition only occurs in rural bank and multi-finance institutions. Business threat of fintech startup does not occur in commercial bank.

This consequently puts the financial services industry under additional pressure and constant growing competition from the financial sector participants, from large technology companies such as Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, from large FinTech companies such as PayPal, Moven, TransferWise, mobile network operators and other existing and potential market players. The implementation of the new EU Payment Service Directive (PSD2), which allows non-financial companies to provide access to financial services for bank customers, is expected to disrupt the financial services industry as we know it, and make traditional financial services providers and banks, in particular, think of new creative business models to remain competitive. In the process of doing this, changing the landscape of payments and creating new risks for banking business. With this study we aim to assess the new EU Payment Service regulation in the context of industry competitiveness. The study is based on the examination of the PSD2 Directive exploring the opportunities as well as the risks that it will bring to this industry in the near future, and the possibilities of cooperation of the financial services industry with financial technology developers. Moreover, we analyse structured data, collected from a questionnaire based on 4 themes of perception of techs on the importance they have on ensuring competitiveness, conducted with European tech companies. Most of the questionnaire participants believe that the Payment Services Directive 2 will promote competitiveness, innovations and development. Moreover, findings show that comparativeness is related mainly to low costs and customer satisfaction. However, it is also shown that high quality of products/services as well as relatively high speed of transactions and security, privacy and risk are also perceived as important. © 2018 International Strategic Management Association.

Recently, intelligent sensors, computer vision and natural language understanding (NLU) based on deep learning (DL) help vehicle engineers to finish autonomous driving experiments. Autonomy is a symbolic, essential feature of machine intelligence. Though AI and deep learning tech is developing rapidly, it has rarely been used in the field of space satellites and deep space exploration. Intelligentization, autonomy, flexibility and must be the trend of future aerospace activities, which would improve explorer' s efficiency. Innovative performance of deep learning in robot vision, information processing and humanoid understanding just provide helpful, feasible tools for future satellite system and deep space exploration robots. In computer vision and image processing field deep learning is mainly realized through form of convolutional neural networks (CNN), which is comprised of multiple layers neural networks connected with sparse interaction and parameters sharing. Deep convolutional neural networks with more hidden layers and more complex architectures have more powerful ability of feature representation and feature learning, compared with conventional algorithm in feature extraction such as SIFT and SURF. In this paper, the basic structure of CNN, feature extraction using convolution and pooling operations are summarized. Then taking mission on Mars surface for instance, we proposed a scheme of highly intelligent robot. It has the capacity of terrain detection, target recognition, obstacle position-fix and material search. The DCNN is based on rectified linear unit (ReLU) and padding convolutional layer (PCL) to improve the accuracy of recognition and localization. A trained DCNN in clear dataset is embedded as a feature extractor in a principle-regularized Keras on CNTK framework, to overcome the limitation of less data in real Martian environment. We expect Mars robots could deal with the environment's complexity and uncertainly by using of DCNN, travel on the Mars and carry out scientific tasks. It will bring innovative changes in the field of deep space autonomous exploration. Â© 2018 by the International Astronautical Federation. All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85065325418

The financial and legal doctrine and the development of Russian banking legislation and law enforcement practice testify to the growing role of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation in the financial activities of the state. This also applies to issues of the implementation by the Bank of Russia of the regulatory function as an element of its public-law status. The public-law status of the Bank of Russia assumes its authority in such distinguished aspects as: a subject ensuring national security, a subject ensuring economic security; a subject of strategic planning; a subject implementing the strategy of financial literacy improvement; a subject implementing the strategy for protecting the rights and legitimate interests of consumers of financial services; a subject providing a critical information infrastructure in the banking sector and other areas of the financial market. In modern conditions, there is a forming trend of expansive release of conceptual program documents by the Bank of Russia. We can differentiate two types of conceptual program documents issued by the Bank of Russia: these are, firstly, conceptual program documents based on setting forth provisions on their status in federal laws and, secondly, conceptual program documents issued by the Bank of Russia on its initiative, i.e. for reasons not specified in federal laws. These relevant issues of monetary policy, financial market and financial technology development, availability of banking services, reflected in the above conceptual program documents, can be described as elements of the concept of the legislative policy of the Central Bank of the Russian Federation. Conceptual program documents of the Bank of Russia determine the directions of statutory regulation and law enforcement practice of the Bank of Russia. This reflects the interconnection and interdependence of the types of the Bank of Russia's legal acts as elements of its competence to implement legally mandated functions, including the function of ensuring banking security: regulatory, law enforcement, and interpretative acts as well as treaties of the Bank of Russia. From the standpoint of the principle of legality of banking activity, a proposal is made to fill gaps in legal regulation.

"Stewart H., Jürjens J.",Data security and consumer trust in FinTech innovation in Germany,2018.0,Cyber security; Data security; FinTech; Information security; Mobile banking,"Purpose: The purpose of this study is to empirically analyse the key factors that influence the adoption of financial technology innovation in the country Germany. The advancement of mobile devices and their usage have increased the uptake of financial technology (FinTech) innovation. Financial sectors and startups see FinTech as a gateway to increase business opportunities, but mobile applications and other technology platforms must be launched to explore such opportunities. Mobile application security threats have increased tremendously and have become a challenge for both users and FinTech innovators. In this paper, the authors empirically inspect the components that influence the expectations of both users and organizations to adopt FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, user interface design and FinTech promotion. The empirical results definitely confirm that data security, customer trust and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. Existing studies have used the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to address this issue. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Design/methodology/approach: In this paper, the authors empirically consider factors that influence the expectations of both users and organizations in adopting FinTech, such as customer trust, data security, value added, the user design interface and FinTech promotion. The results confirm that customer trust, data security and the user design interface affect the adoption of FinTech. This research proposes a model called “Intention to adopt FinTech in Germany,” constructs of which were developed based on the TAM and five additional components, as identified. The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to achieve economies of scale for global intensity. Findings: The authors demonstrated that the number of mobile users in Germany is rapidly increasing; yet the adoption of FinTech is extremely sluggish. It is intriguing to reckon that 99 per cent of respondents had mobile devices, but only 10 per cent recognized FinTech. Further, it is significantly discouraging to perceive that only 10 of the 209 respondents had ever used FinTech services, representing under 1 per cent of the surveyed respondents. It is obvious that the FinTech incubators and banks offering FinTech services need to persuade their customers regarding the usefulness and value added advantages of FinTech. This study has been carried out to determine the key factors that influence and provoke FinTech adoption. Research limitations/implications: There are a few limitations in this study. Initially, this study focuses on FinTech implementation in Germany and not the whole of Europe. In addition, demographic and regional factors could be consolidated to inspect their particular impact on the intention to use FinTech services, particularly among younger users with a high interest in technology. Without these constraints, the authors could have gathered additional data for a more robust result and obtained new knowledge to further upgrade polices to enhance the FinTech adoption process. Future analysts can assist exploration of this topic by altering determinants in the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model. Additionally, because the cluster sampling technique was used, the reported outcomes are not 100 per cent generalized to the German population. To accomplish a complete generalization, a basic random sampling strategy for the whole population is essential. The authors could also alleviate some limitations by examining how online vendors are performing with regard to FinTech to satisfy the needs of customers via case studies. Practical implications: This study was conducted in Germany and might have produced different results if held in other countries, as technology acceptance is different in a different environment. For instance, the authors suspect that the results would be somewhat different, were the research to be conducted in the United Kingdom, where take-up of FinTech appears to be far greater than in Germany. Therefore, the authors’ results are only generalized for the country of Germany and not other geographical areas. Furthermore, respondents may have been influenced by past experiences about FinTech usage which might have led them to neglect to answer some questions. In spite of this, this study did not consider the influence of moderating variables such as age, education and FinTech services experience. The authors also neglected social impact and control factors, as their corresponding items disregarded the instrument dependability. Accordingly, the authors could not quantify social impact and control factors on FinTech use. Social implications: The outcomes of this study can be used to improve the performance of FinTech strategies and enable banks to accomplish economies of scale for global intensity. The authors do hope that this paper will serve to encourage FinTech innovators in their approach to FinTech and enable FinTech researchers to use past work with more prominent certainty, resulting in rigid hypothesis improvement in the future. Originality/value: A considerable amount of revenue has been invested in the information technology (IT) infrastructure of banks to enhance their performance, but investment in IT remains a substantial risk regarding the return on investment (Carlson, 2015). Most banks and financial organizations around the globe are engaging in an extreme pressure from their customers and competitors to enhance IT. © 2018, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-85044286793

Through previous researches, it was confirmed that the most important factor affecting the intention of using mobile easy payment service was perceived usefulness, and the factors influencing perceived usefulness were classified as personal characteristics, service characteristics, environmental characteristics and service characteristics. The purpose of this study is to investigate whether people with experience using mobile easy payment service will continue to use the service in the future and what factors influence the intention to use the service continuously. The results of the study showed that the variables of personal characteristics and service characteristics influenced the intention to use continuously in the future through perceived usefulness. In addition, it has been found that the various gaps between the layers are important factors in the future intention of mobile payment service. According to the results of this study, the important national task in spreading mobile payment service is suggesting that how to resolve the smart divide and the income gap is an important policy task. © 2018 SERSC Australia.",Article,2-s2.0-85082365508

Regulators can find themselves in a situation where they believe they must opt for either reckless action (regulation without sufficient facts) or paralysis (doing nothing). Inevitably in such a situation, caution tends to trump risk. But such caution merely functions to reinforce the status quo and the result is that new technologies may struggle to reach the market in a timely or efficient manner. The solution? Law-making and regulatory design needs to become more proactive, dynamic and responsive. So how can regulators actually achieve these goals? What can they do to promote innovation and offer better opportunities to people wanting to build a new business around a disruptive technology or simply enjoy the benefits of a disruptive new technology as a consumer? The chapter focuses on three possible strategies for ‘regulation tomorrow’. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2018.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85075952673

The current methods of evaluating the effectiveness, usability, and ease of use of these web platforms are rudimentary and subjective, as they rely largely on traditional survey measures and may fail to uncover critical usability issues with a platform. When companies launch such web platforms, early adopter users are usually faced with an array of issues, ranging from ineffective navigation to poor layout, which may cause consumers to lose trust and eventually switch to other brands and services. There has been a long-standing need to develop more effective methods to assess web platforms. We propose and empirically validate a multimodal approach that combines traditional methods (survey and performance measures) with physiological (eye-tracking and neuroimaging) measures to enable more holistic and rigorous testing of web platforms. This approach overcomes the limitations of traditional methods and enables a more comprehensive usability assessment. © 2019 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85075713960

Digital innovation leads to challenges for incumbent firms in adapting to changing rules set by new competitors and higher customer expectations. However, young firms providing technical solutions for the financial services industry (fintechs) also face difficulties; for instance, in meeting high regulatory requirements. Increasing alliances in the financial services industry can be observed due to shortcom- ings on the side of banks and fintechs. We conducted interviews to examine the motives of these alliance partners. The resulting motives are categorized as matching, comple- mentary, and neutral.

These business and regulatory challenges are particularly significant given the broad reach of AI, as well as the multiple uncertainties surrounding such technologies and their future development and effects. This chapter identifies two promising strategies for meeting the “AI challenge,” focusing on the example of Fintech. First, “dynamic regulation,” in the form of regulatory sandboxes and other regulatory approaches that aim to provide a space for responsible AI-related innovation. An empirical study provides preliminary evidence to suggest that jurisdictions that adopt a more “proactive” approach to Fintech regulation can attract greater investment. The second strategy relates to so-called “innovation ecosystems.” It is argued that such ecosystems are most effective when they afford opportunities for creative partnerships between well-established corporations and AI-focused startups and that this aspect of a successful innovation ecosystem is often overlooked in the existing discussion. The chapter suggests that these two strategies are interconnected, in that greater investment is an important element in both fostering and signaling a well-functioning innovation ecosystem and that a well-functioning ecosystem will, in turn, attract more funding. The resulting synergies between these strategies can, therefore, provide a jurisdiction with a competitive edge in becoming a regional hub for AI-related activity. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2018.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85066062814

It is shown that fintech initiatives have not yet led to a radical transformation of the financial sector in Russia because participants of the fintech ecosystem have different points of view on fintech. Russian banks are now developing fintech initiatives within themselves, encouraging technology companies and fintech startups to focus their efforts on innovations that are aimed at improving processes, rather than opening new markets.

The preliminary results suggest that professionals with financial job title or work experiences in finance industry are more likely to switch to a FinTech job. Meanwhile, the finance or computing major also has a positive effect on switching to a FinTech job. Further analysis shows that FinTech professionals in FinTech startups and FinTech incumbent firms exhibit significant different human capital characteristics, which indicates that startups put more attention to IT workers's leadership and prior startup experience while FinTech incumbent firms focus more on IT techniques and IT educational background when hiring employees. More interestingly, both of the FinTech startups and incumbent firms prefer hiring professionals with either specialized finance or computing background rather than those with both financial and computing backgrounds.

For example, company earnings are calculated from total revenue minus total costs and each variable can be further decomposed into several accounting items. This property leads to a relatively new research problem. When the dependent variable for prediction has a hierarchical structure, which level of aggregation may be the optimal choice for prediction? Is it possible to use the information from the predictions of all component variables to enhance the prediction accuracy of the focal variable of interests? To solve this problem, this paper designs a novel forecasting method-Hierarchical Stacking of LSTM (HSL)-by using various data mining techniques. Our proposed solution consists of two stages. In the first phase, by LSTM-RNN, the proposed method makes predictions of the dependent variable given different candidate decompositions. Meanwhile, we devise a method creative use of Genetic algorithm to search for the top-performing decompositions of the dependent variable. In the second stage, the ensemble learning method by Stacking is applied to aggregate several predictions from top-performing decompositions. An empirical evaluation on earning forecast of public companies illustrates that HSL can outperform other existing methods. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85062493875

This is an over-simplification of the role of relationships, contract law, and risk. We believe there is a gap in the understanding of the capabilities of SC's. With that in mind we seek to define an amorphous term and clarify the capabilities of SC's, intending to facilitate future SC research. We've examined the legal, technical, and IS views from an academic and practitioner's perspective. We conclude that SC's have taken many forms, becoming a suitcase word for any sort of code stored on a blockchain, including the embodiment of contractual terms; and that the immutable nature of SC's is a barrier to their adoption in uncertain and multi-contextual environments. © International Conference on Information Systems 2018, ICIS 2018.All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85062493527

As everyone prepares for a new era in Digital Banking and Internet Finance, now is a uniquely opportune moment to harness the power of innovation for an undisputed good: Financial Inclusion. Starting with M-PESA in Kenya, innovations in financial inclusion have been instrumental in bringing financial services to those that need it the most. At this moment, fintech innovation and financial inclusion are meeting in an unlikely place: Myanmar. After emerging from decades of isolation and economic mismanagement under military rule, Myanmar now has the fastest growing economy in Southeast Asia, and, uniquely, the 52 million people that live in the country are gaining access to the latest technology for the first time. At this exciting point in Myanmar's history, there is an opportunity for true digital leapfrogging for financial inclusion. This chapter gives a detailed picture of Myanmar amid its unprecedented transformation, and a seminal call for the innovators of the world in fintech and digital banking to consider Myanmar the next financial inclusion frontier. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Thanks to the supportive economic and policy environment, the growth of digital financial services (""DFS"") in China over the past decade has been phenomenal, making China now one of the world's largest DFS markets. In the meantime, the digital finance boom has created serious concerns and challenges for Chinese regulators in relation to issues such as financial stability, consumer protection, illegal financial activities, etc. To address these issues, the Chinese government has committed to develop a comprehensive framework for the regulation and supervision of DFS and has taken a balanced approach whereby the promotion of DFS will continue under such a framework so as to ensure the sustainable development of DFS. The major challenges ahead are to ensure the regulatory framework has the potential to deal with new forms of DFS and new problems associated with DFS, and to balance the regulation of DFS with its healthy growth. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Trends in Robo-advisory for Financial Investment Services,2018.0,Fintech; Retail investors; Robo-advisory services,"Brokerages are one of the first financial institutions to embrace the Internet and put their services online. This is a natural progression as trading ideally requires real-time information and action. Technology allowed the introduction of computerized quantitative analytics with increased digitization; it became crucial to have access to the fastest information. When first introduced, this technology was beyond the reach of everyday retail investors. As markets became efficient (supported by low latency technology), the number of active retail investors dwindled. However, in recent years, we saw a re-emergence of retail investment activity with the offering of new low-cost ""fintech"" platforms such as robo-advisors.The development of robo-advisory services is changing behavior of individual retail investors, giving them direct and low-cost access to a wide range of global multi-asset class investments. This chapter explores the evolution of robo-advisors and trends by examining a few industry cases. We conclude by discussing the role of robo-advisors in creating an inclusive investing environment. © 2018 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85054426834

As new platforms and technologies are introduced to the market, and the boundaries of traditional business models are challenged, financial services can be provided with greater accountability, efficiency and accessibility. Ant Financial, China's largest Fintech company in the making, is set to revolutionize the China's financial network, including payment, wealth management and loans. It focuses on the underserved markets by the major Chinese banks: the low-income individuals, especially those in the rural areas. Ant Financial has leveraged on Taobao's platform, along with Alibaba's rural Taobao Strategy, to give out loans and help traditional agricultural business to set up shops on Taobao. Alibaba also introduced Taobao rural service centers, where villagers can get accustomed to making purchases and paying bills online, as well as picking up items they bought on Taobao. Alibaba provides computers and trains villagers to serve as its representatives in the centers, which are often in convenience stores. With Fintech advancements, access to products and financial services is becoming more accessible than ever.

Patwardhan A.,Peer-To-Peer Lending,2018.0,Banking; Digital business; Financial innovation; Fintech; Marketplace lending; Peer-to-peer lending,Banking is at an inflection point. Most people think that banking is being reshaped by regulations since the global financial crisis but that is only half the story. The other half is about technology. The multi-trillion-dollar financial services industry is being digitally disrupted and digitally re-imagined. The global financial crisis resulted in a debate on the 'too-big-to-fail' banks but it also created a 'too-small-to-care' crisis for small businesses as banks scaled back their lending to the SME sector. Marketplace lending platforms are supporting financial inclusion and providing the much needed access to capital to small businesses that have traditionally been the Goldilocks of digital banking; corporate applications are too complex for them and retail ones are way too simple. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Despite US$11 trillion in quantitative easing since 2007, economic growth has been persistently sluggish. The money isn't going where it should be. In 2015, McKinsey reported that global debt had grown by US$57 trillion since 2007. The debt is becoming unsustainable, yet the global debt-to-income ratio continues to rise disproportionally to any deleveraging. The Fed's meandering signaling to nudge up interest rates beyond the near zero range raises concerns that private and even public debt could become unserviceable, reeling the economy back into a serious recession. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

We adopt a sliding-window procedure to capture the dynamics of the co-search networks and develop panel-data models to examine the impact of the network structure on individual stock performance. By arguing the heterogeneous information flows transmitting through the network matter for an ego's future performance, we explicitly divide the alters of an ego stock into two distinct groups based on their historical return trends. Our empirical results suggest an increase of network centrality and closure among historical winners can positively contribute to an ego's future return whereas that among historical losers can exert significant and negative impact. We also find a higher level of centrality is associated with a lower level of future volatility. © 2018 Association for Information Systems. All rights reserved.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85054285503

With the decrease in cash payments and an increased ease of paying online or by credit card, consumers do not feel the ""pain of paying"" anymore. Certain situations might tempt consumers to adverse impulse purchases. Many applications already leverage user profiles to create individual experiences tailored to the user. Knowing the user's current context can be used by a system to detect anomalies in behavior and warn the user. We propose a family of systems that evaluate purchase intentions based on the current user situation. The user will be notified about adverse impulse purchases and unusual behavior, so that s/he can cancel these transactions.

"Wang M., Chang Y.","Technology Leadership, Brand Equity, and Customer Loyalty towards Fintech Service Providers in China",2018.0,Brand equity; Customer loyalty; Technology leadership,"China claims the world's largest mobile payments market and serves as the global benchmark for other markets to pursue. As the battle over the Chinese mobile wallet market wages on, the gap between leading players WeChat Pay (owned by Tencent) and Alipay remains narrow. Based on brand equity theory and symbolic value theory, a research model is proposed to investigate the relationship between Fintech's technology leadership, brand equity, and customer loyalty. The results show that Alipay provides more innovative and diversified financial services and outperforms WeChat Pay in technology leadership. The study confirms that technology leadership positively affects brand equity, which in turn positively affects customer loyalty. The boundary condition for different type of customers is considered and implications for theory and practice are also discussed. © 2018 Association for Information Systems.

The main trends of FinTech platforms development in the EU countries, such as the level of investment, impact of EU FinTech platforms on the global scale, features of investments into B2B FinTech, were determined. It was considered that in Ukraine, some positive changes in legislation were adopted, but the challenges like lack of finance, slow adoption of innovations in the financial market, not sufficient clarity of legislation remain among the main constraints for further development of FinTech platforms in Ukraine. The conducted analysis on the level of FinTech types performance by Ukrainian platforms showed only the great share of digital payments and money transfers, while other modern innovative FinTech instruments should not be underestimated for proper FinTech application in Ukraine. For this purpose, the authors have developed the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations that consolidates interests of both SMEs and scientists. To determine both the SMEs’ opinion about the necessity of a particular Internet platform for them and the types of services that could be provided by the sme-sci.com platform, the authors conducted a survey in which 374 medium-sized and 380 small businesses took part. The results of the survey that are presented in the article confirm the necessity of the Information Platform on Support for SMEs’ Innovations and demand for it from the SMEs.

User authentication is made by inputting password on smartphone. Methods/Statistical analysis: Banks or fintech service providers receive password using a security keypads, but attackers take a peep at passwords by various ways such as Google Glass or shoulder surfing attack. Because the locations of keypads are almost fixed and the size of keypads is almost the same, they are vulnerable to attacks using the touched location or shoulder surfing attacks. Findings: To protect security and safety from various attacks such as the stealing of touched location using Google Glass, shoulder surfing attack, or malware, this study proposes to diversify the size of keypads, connect the keys as a Tetris game but randomly align them to left or right, and add paddings in-between the keypads so that it is difficult to infer a password by the information of touched location. Improvements/Applications: Since a different letter is entered even if the same key is touched, it will be difficult for the attacker to infer the password through this proposed technique.

Design/methodology/approach: The authors analyze the importance for such a standard of software that turns natural language contracts into cash flow generating algorithms; a data dictionary that standardizes contract terms; and access to variables that represent the state of the world (e.g. market risk, counterparty risk, etc.) that affect contractual obligations. Findings: The ability to realize benefits from the use of such a contract level algorithmic standard depends on the following: making the standard’s software open source; fully testing the software to have complete confidence in its accuracy; and enabling the software to use of a wide range of models of various sources of risk (market, credit and behavior risk) to support forward-looking analysis. Such a standard would solve the disconnect that exists in financial firms between the representation of financial contracts for transaction processing and analysis. The ACTUS Financial Research Foundation is building, testing and making available such a standard that represents almost all financial contracts extant in markets. Practical implications: The adoption of such a standard would reduce the costs of operations of financial firms, provide the computational infrastructure for more effective regulatory oversight, reduce regulatory reporting costs and improve financial market transparency. It would also enable the assessment of systemic risk by directly quantifying the interconnectedness of firms.

In the current world, mostly all the transactions are done through online which mainly includes the bank as a “middle man,” which could be untrustworthy at times. Blockchain comes into the picture which eliminates the need of a middle man or third party between the users who are involved in the transactions. Represents a financial ledger entry of data structure which consists of record of transactions which is digitally signed and cannot be tampered as authenticity is ensured in which the ledger is considered to be of high integrity. One of the leading and highly valued platform of blockchain is “Hyperledger Fabric” which is meant for securing transactions and serves a powerful container technology for smart contract development in the global capital firms. The potential of Blockchain and DLT in capital markets in this upcoming world could remove many of the inefficiencies and costs inherent in the global capital markets across the world and could be considered as a viable technology which enable to settlement.

Recent changes in financial regulation in the United States have spurred evolution of equity crowdfunding as a potential alternative to traditional sources of venture capital. To address the relative lack of knowledge about success factors, we focus on Title III equity crowdfunding platforms in the United States that are open to non-accredited investors. We draw on traditional venture finance research and we examine the effects of market, execution and agency risks in equity crowdfunding under Title III. We collect data on 133 ventures that attracted more than $11 million in funding commitments across sixteen Title III equity crowdfunding platforms. We find that all three types of risks can affect the likelihood of successful fundraising under Title III.

Across Europe there is no common practice of using the credit data of consumers, which can be exploited for several purposes. Traditionally, they are used by the lending industry as a risk-management tool to underwrite borrowing decisions or price risks, but they can also be used as a practice of creditworthiness assessment. In some Member States, consumer data are part of a broader information centralisation system for the prudential supervision of banks and the financial system as a whole. Within this already complex picture, emerging technologies and the processing of new generations of personal data are starting to give way to new business models that can transform retail financial markets (Fintechs). Whatever the function the data perform, their source, type, breath, and depth differ greatly from country to country. Unlike for the harmonisation of EU rules on credit to consumers for the creation of the internal market, the underlying consumer data infrastructure remains fragmented at national level, failing to achieve univocal, common, or defined policy objectives under a harmonised legal framework. Likewise, the establishment of the Banking Union and the prudential supervision of the Euro-area demand standardisation and convergence of the data used to measure debt levels, arrears, and delinquencies. The many functions and different usages of credit data suggest that the policy goals to be achieved should inform the design and structure of the databases, as well as the role, legal, and institutional framework of the organisations managing the data system (the Data Brokers). This is also because fundamental rights and consumer protection concerns arise from the dissemination and sharing of traditional and non-traditional data, as well as from their expanding uses. This is an area of the EU internal market that demands the attention of the EU legislator without further delays. © 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston.",Article,2-s2.0-85037860969

Walch A.,Open-Source Operational Risk: Should Public Blockchains Serve as Financial Market Infrastructures?,2018.0,Bitcoin; Blockchain; DLT; Ethereum; Financial market infrastructure; Fintech; Open-source software; Operational risk; Risk; Software forks,"This chapter explores the operational risks raised by the use of common 'grassroots' open-source software practices in public blockchains, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, in their potential role as financial market infrastructures. These practices include the informal software development process, problematic funding for software development, and the possibility of forking inherent to open-source software. The paper argues that the risks raised by these practices significantly undermine public blockchains' suitability to serve as financial market infrastructures. Further, they herald the need to reevaluate the use of these practices outside the blockchain technology setting, in other critical infrastructures based on grassroots open-source software. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The purpose of the paper is to investigate how financial services industry participants perceive the effect of digital disruption as well as to explore what strategies are being adopted by incumbents in the face of potential disruption from fintech challengers. Based on an exploratory study with stakeholders from the financial ecosystem in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA), the findings show that the fintech sector is still nascent, but is likely to be disruptive in selected product and customer segments. Multiple regulatory, structural, and cultural obstacles stand in the way of fintech adoption. Incumbents’ preferred strategy to face the future disruption is the bank-fintech collaboration, which will create new value for ecosystem partners and speed up innovation. Our study adds useful insights to the body of knowledge related to disruptive innovations in general and fintech in emerging markets in particular. Specifically, the collaborative response is inconsistent with the strategies usually recommended for incumbents in disruptive innovation theory. We hypothesize that our participants’ preference for partnering can be explained in the light of the distinctive characteristics of the digital economy. We propose a framework for creating a financial services platform embedded in a broader ecosystem to facilitate the bank-fintech collaboration. © 2017, University of Finance and Management in Warsaw.

Nowadays, there is a raise in the popularity of novel financial technologies such as digital currencies, social trading platforms and distributed ledger payments, but there is a lack of approaches to enforce the aforementioned regulations accordingly. Software tools are developed to detect suspicious transactions usually based on knowledge from experts in the domain, but as new criminal tactics emerge, detection mechanisms must be updated. Suspicious activity examples are scarce or nonexistent, hindering the use of supervised machine learning methods. In this paper, we describe a methodology for analyzing financial information without the use of ground truth. A user suspicion ranking is generated in order to facilitate human expert validation using an ensemble of anomaly detection algorithms. We apply our procedure over two case studies: one related to bank fund movements from a private company and the other concerning Ripple network transactions. We illustrate how both examples share interesting similarities and that the resulting user ranking leads to suspicious findings, showing that anomaly detection is a must in both traditional and modern payment systems. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85044028003

This leverages complicated business networks space to include scalable network layers, more devices, and platforms relying on Internet of Things (IoT) solutions. Despite the fact that traditional IoT platforms usually target the technical side for IoT applications, they are not prepared enough to be easily integrated with pluggable and executable business logic or smart contracts. This makes it difficult to control a collection of shared business network resources in a standard and decentralized manner. With the rise of FinTech due to blockchain technology, it becomes possible to seamlessly engage business networks with financial digital assets. Consequently, combining IoT platforms with blockchain will drive new ways for better services consuming, transparency and products that depend on crowd-based economy[12]. In this paper, Sitechain is proposed as a new architecture to integrate IoT platforms with blockchain technology. The proposed architecture is not locked to specific IoT platforms but it can be extended to support different platforms in a standard, systematic and easy way. Sitechain is demonstrated by integrating Sitewhere and FIWAREIoT platforms with Hyperledger Fabric as a private blockchain network manager. Moreover a modeling language supported by Hyperledger composer is used to easily develop smart contracts and generate RESTful APIs, therefore any smart contract transaction events can bemapped into actions on remote devices.The system testing is performed using a large set of connected shared devices that are deployed as part of private business networks.

It follows electronic media at the NYSE over a roughly ten-year period, from the time of the deployment of a computer called the Market Data System (MDS) through debates surrounding the National Market System and the passage of the 1975 Securities Acts Amendments. Building on research at the archives of the NYSE and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), this history emphasizes the regulatory and managerial contexts in which market data became computerized. The SEC viewed market automation as both necessary for the viability of the securities industry and a mechanism for expanding regulatory oversight over the venues of stock trading. Moving from the MDS to later technical projects in the late 1960s and early 1970s, this article charts the changing meaning of electronic governance in a market increasingly conceptualized as a technical object. Adding to recent work in the social studies of finance and financial technologies, this history sites early NYSE computerization programs within managerial efforts to consolidate control over the clerical labor of financial markets, and in contests between regulatory and market institutions. It concludes by exploring the differing forms of electronic governance activated in these efforts to bring computers into the market. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Article,2-s2.0-85034590482

We examine the impact of the funding of such start-ups on the stock returns of 47 incumbent US retail banks for 2010 to 2016. Methods: To capture the importance of FinTech start-ups, we use data on both the dollar-volume of funding and number of deals. We relate these to the stock returns with panel data regression methods. Results: Our results indicate a positive relationship exists between the growth in FinTech funding or deals and the contemporaneous stock returns of incumbent retail banks. Conclusions: Although these results suggest complementarity between FinTech and traditional banking, we note that our results at the banking industry level are not statistically significant, and that the coefficient signs for about one-third of the banks are negative, but not statistically significant. Since the FinTech industry is young and our sample period short, we cannot rule out that our findings are spurious. © 2017, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85056129204

Digital finance technologies, including blockchain, have empowered a type of crescive entrepreneurship that seeks opportunities in relation to financially excluded individuals. This article hypothesizes that nonmonetary causal factors and informal financial practices play a major role in habits of the financially excluded, which would favor blockchain's disintermediation features over the incumbent approach. After applying fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) to determine the conditions related to financial practice and motivations that explain the absence of a formal bank account, I prescribe five sensitivities that blockchain entrepreneurs need to consider when targeting this segment. The value of this article's approach extends well beyond traditional unisystemic views for financial inclusion, as blockchain-based entrepreneurial opportunities emerge to reveal alternative forms of disintermediated financial services, which we exemplify in startups modeling informal practices. Blockchain entrepreneurship can generate semi-formal financial services that bring financial aspirations closer to people.

This study attempts to propose a framework to identify emerging areas and trends using financial business method patents. Based on the abstracts of financial business method patents registered at the United States Patent and Trademark Office, this study first applies latent Dirichlet allocation to identify emerging topics. The probability of the annual occurrence of each topic is adjusted through the exponentially weighted moving average to reflect the importance of the recent probability of topics. Each topic is classified as ""hot"" or ""cold"" depending on whether the exponentially weighted moving average of the probabilities exceeds the threshold. We applied survival analysis to the time gap of recurrently becoming hot from a cold status with the associated factor of financial business method patents. The findings suggest that the topic with the short granted period and high forward citation is likely to become hot. In addition, the topic that is aged and specific in narrow areas is likely to continuously change into the hot or cold status. The approach proposed in this study contributes toward understanding topic emergence in the financial area and pursuing sustainable development. © 2017 by the authors.",Article,2-s2.0-85029706696

However, most of the interface descriptions of Web APIs are informal, and the Web API SLA contracts, which are a key to quality of services orchestration, require manual operations at the consumers. Meanwhile, applying the blockchain, the distributed ledger technology, to various domains beyond Fintech is attracting attention because of its fault-tolerant and anti-tampering. However, it isn't applied to Web API SLA contracts, yet. In this article, the authors propose a formal specification description of Web APIs together with its associated SLA specifications based on RDF, and an SLA contract method based on the common SLA contract platform built on the blockchain.

Thompson B.S.,Can Financial Technology Innovate Benefit Distribution in Payments for Ecosystem Services and REDD+?,2017.0,Benefit sharing; Conservation; Economic incentives; Environmental services; Mobile payments; Transaction cost,"Benefit distribution in Payments for Ecosystem Services (PES) and REDD+ involves the disbursement of cash or in-kind incentives to local participants that opt to manage their land in ways that increase or maintain ecosystem service provision. For decades, existing benefit distribution approaches have been debated by academics, and presented challenges for conservation practitioners. In passing through long chains of project actors, payments incur high transaction costs and are susceptible to elite capture and corruption. A new type of financial technology (FinTech) – ‘mobile money’ – could offer a novel and available solution to these challenges, at what is now a critical stage in PES and REDD+ implementation. Mobile payments (made via cell phones) have been used successfully in development projects related to micro-credit, micro-insurance, and aid relief, and this commentary considers their possible advantages and drawbacks for PES/REDD+ schemes. Several countries e.g. Cambodia, China, Tanzania, and the Philippines demonstrate both high PES/REDD+ uptake, and high mobile money penetration. In certain circumstances benefit distribution via FinTech may lower transaction costs, enable higher frequency payments, and provide new socioeconomic benefits. It could also improve the privacy, transparency, traceability, and security of disbursements, contributing to more efficient and equitable PES and REDD+ schemes. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.",Note,2-s2.0-85018341932

Nowadays, main business models in FinTech are thirdparty payment, peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, and crowd-funding. P2P lending is the work of lending money to individuals or small and medium-sized enterprises through online services that match lenders and borrowers directly within websites. The matching considers risks and requirements of both lenders and borrowers, offers lenders with attractive return rates and credit worthy borrowers, and provides the service more cheaply than traditional financial institutions with lower overhead and threshold. Hence, P2P lending is the key and an important trend of Fintech. However, without financial institutions, P2P lending will cause risk management problems including credit risk, business risk, and market risk. Unfortunately, no adequate regulation are provided to protect the unsecure personal loan due to the rapid progress and beyond the laws. Still, P2P lending platforms enable borrowers to propose expected interest rates and lenders to reduce transaction risks, and greatly improve matching efficiency. Therefore, this study mines the association rules from the famous P2P lending website Zopa by analyzing basic member data and past transactions. The discovered associations and distributions can further be used in suggesting the optimal decisions for the borrowers so that the matching will be more effective. In this paper, the borrowers' data in the P2P platform is targeted, factors including the total number of payments, interest collected, terms, lending rate, latest status, and postcode are extracted to assist matching the suitable borrowers so that both parties may have higher transaction satisfaction. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85037728494

RegTech to date has focused on the digitization of manual reporting and compliance processes, for example in the context of know-your-customer requirements. This offers tremendous cost savings to the financial services industry and regulators. However, the potential of RegTech is far greater - it could enable close to real-time monitoring and a proportionate regulatory regime that addresses risk and facilitates more efficient regulatory compliance. We argue that the transformative nature of technology will only be captured by a new approach that sits at the nexus between data, digital identity, and regulation. We seek to expose the inadequacy and lack of ambition of simply digitizing analogue processes in a digital financial world. The development of financial technology ('FinTech'), rapid developments in emerging markets, and the recent pro-active stance of regulators in developing regulatory sandboxes, represent a unique combination of events, which could facilitate the transition from one regulatory model to another. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Applicable to analyze how companies can improve their branding strategies in highly regulated industries. Case overview: In 2016, Claire Solís was discussing with her team the paths to ignite growth and brand awareness of the only digital bank in Mexico. To better position the brand on the Mexican financial market, Bankaool had decided to go 100 per cent online, a branch-less institution. The case presents a condensed history of banking and the shifts in digital consumer behavior. As the case continues, Bankaool products are introduced along with some concerns to keep the business going, particularly, regarding the bank’s health and further growth. The newly appointed CMO and her team have to decide next steps to boost product growth just before the Fintech industry grows more mature and competitive – a scenario of more complex decisions. While they reckoned the potential of Bankaool in sales for the short term, they also need a strategy to position the Bankaool brand in the long term while they struggle with a need to accelerate growth and generate a return for investors. Expected learning outcomes: To understand the launching of a new bank in the digital arena. To understand consumer behavior in a setting of increasingly higher digital coverage and diffusion of smart devices. To recognize that brand value goes well beyond product development and launch. To gain awareness on the perks and perils of a digital-only bank. Supplementary materials: Teaching Notes are available for educators only.

This is causing strong concern regarding a potential collapse of the music industry comparable to other print media industries such as newspaper and book publishing. However, recent changes in the music industry initiated by a resurgence of the live music industry are giving rise to some expectations for the survival and growth of the music industry. The parallel paths of increasing popularity of streaming services and a resurgence of live music suggest that these two dynamics are working together in a co-evolutionary way toward the sustainability of the music industry. This paper attempts to elucidate the co-evolutionary dynamism between the increasing popularity of streaming music and the resurgence of live music. An empirical analysis of monthly trends over the period of the last three decades in the US music industry by its sectors revealed that (i) the co-evolution between streaming and live music industries has functioned well over the last few years, (ii) the live music industry has incorporated a self-propagating function by assimilating innovations previously initiated by digital music, (iii) given the above co-evolution, the recent resurging trend in the music industry can be sustained, (iv) the advancement of digital innovations such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, fintech, virtual reality, big data, and social media by enabling such coevolution have transformed the live music industry into a “live-concert-streaming music industry” (LCSMI) that further enabling the participative creativity of its stakeholders.

This has come with great challenges especially in decision making and in engaging the pre-tail for launching new products and services in an open environment susceptible to high risks and threats. A prodigious need to build a sellers reputation and trust between the seller and the buyer so as to diminish such risks and threats in online trading birthed the idea of reputation systems. The emergence of reputation systems has attracted a lot of researchers to propose rating aggregation methods such as simple mean and normal distribution based method. However, the existing methods cannot accurately produce reputation score in some cases. Hence, this paper proposes a new model aiming to producing even more accurate and effective reputation score. Our model uses the standard beta-distribution considering the received rating distribution, so as to generate the weights of each ratings and then derive the level weights of ratings. The final reputation score is the level weighted aggregation of the rating levels. The proposed model is innovative in the aspect that the ratings are not directly aggregated to the reputation score, but are treated as the samples in evaluating each respective rating levels. Through case studies, the model is demonstrated to achieve desired accuracy and effectiveness, and even performs better than the existing models. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85030461254

Authoritative settlement based on central bank support is seen as being essential for both large value and retail payment systems; and, in the EU, UK, and US, the importance of regulating for the protection of consumers who use retail payment systems is recognised. In this institutional context, payment innovations (including Bitcoin and distributed ledger or autonomous organisation technologies) are assessed. It is suggested that, while competition at certain levels is likely to bring social benefits through commercial developments, the maintenance of public interest objectives necessarily delineates the scope of competition. While this might limit the disruptive impact of payment innovations, it is argued that, in the light of the public policy needs for a stable and efficient public infrastructure and the social needs of confidence and trust in a predictable and regulated payment system that meets commercial and social expectations such as in consumer protection, this is not necessarily undesirable. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Article,2-s2.0-85042916153

This evolution is characterized by expanded connectivity and enhanced speed of information processing both at the customer interface and in back-office processes. Recently, there has been a shift in the focus of digitalization from improving the delivery of traditional tasks to introducing fundamentally new business opportunities and models for financial service companies. Digital Finance encompasses a magnitude of new financial products, financial businesses, finance-related software, and novel forms of customer communication and interaction—delivered by FinTech companies and innovative financial service providers. Against this backdrop, the research on finance and information systems has started to analyze these changes and the impact of digital progress on the financial sector. Therefore, this article reviews the current state of research in Digital Finance that deals with these novel and innovative business functions. Moreover, it gives an outlook on potential future research directions. As a conceptual basis for reviewing this field, the Digital Finance Cube, which embraces three key dimensions of Digital Finance and FinTech, i.e., the respective business functions, the technologies and technological concepts applied as well as the institutions concerned, is introduced. This conceptualization supports researchers and practitioners when orientating in the field of Digital Finance, allows for the arrangement of academic research relatively to each other, and enables for the revelation of the gaps in research. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Article,2-s2.0-85026475185
Alabi K.,Digital blockchain networks appear to be following Metcalfe's Law,2017.0,Blockchain; Cryptocurrency; Digital networks; Distributed ledger systems; Distributed transaction processing; Fintech; Metcalfe's Law; Network effects; Online payments; Payment networks,"An analysis of some of the recent blockchain networks is presented to determine if they satisfy Metcalfe's Law, as has been shown for some online social media networks. The value of the network was modeled based on the price of the digital currency in use on the network, and the number of users by the number of unique addresses each day that engage in transactions on the network. The Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Dash networks were analyzed. The analysis shows that the networks were fairly well modeled by Metcalfe's Law, which identifies the value of a network as proportional to the square of the number of its nodes, or end users. A new network model was also presented that shows the value to be proportional to the exponential of the root of the number of users participating in the network, and shows good agreement as well. Conditions for determining critical mass based on the new model were also presented. Finally, the potential for identifying value bubbles that can be spotted as deviations in value from the model was discussed and illustrated using the data from one of the networks. Those value bubbles show up where repeated extremely high value increases are not accompanied by any commensurate increase in the number of participating users, or any other development that could give rise to the higher value. © 2017",Article,2-s2.0-85021102504

Some affirm that it is the next big thing after the Internet. Blockchain is a network-based technology that rewards participants to assemble transactions which will next configure blocks and later be part of a chain. Blockchain guarantees immutability and integrity of data without the need of a third surveilling party. It is therefore a revolution in current systems of trust. It also brings automation and self-execution of processes thanks to its embedded smart contracts functionality. Current standards drafting and development processes can definitively benefit from blockchain technology, and perhaps see the standardization domain revolutionize, like it already happened in the fintech and insurtech arenas [1]. In this paper, we explain what these advantages are. And, before new standard drafting models emerge from the disruptive blockchain community, challenging traditional standard development models-with this paper-, we want to inspire and give tools to established standardization bodies for them to take the lead and initiate a transformation towards 'Blockchained Standards' so that they can keep their authority and leadership in the field going forward. © 2017 ITU.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85049593543
"Albashrawi M., Motiwalla L.",Understanding mobile banking usage: An integrative perspective,2017.0,IS success model; IT adoption; System usage; UTAUT,"Increasingly, smartphones and mobile commerce are changing consumer transaction behaviors and shifting the ways in which users interact with business. Similarly, the banking and financial industry is now empowered by FinTech applications to improve their consumer experience and banking services to solidify the role for mobile banking (MB) for years to come. In this study, we are taking an integrated approach by combining two IT adoption models: UTAUT and IS Success, and using both subjective and objective measures for mobile banking usage. Our regression results for a sample of 472 bank users in a mid-size US bank find a strong support for satisfaction, objective actual use, and loyalty but not for subjective actual use. These results provide interesting implications for both IS adoption theory and banking institutions for improving satisfaction and use of MB.

The authors reveal the legal regulation problems, elimination of which will contribute to development of syndicated lending to domestic borrowers and, as consequence, growth of the real sector of the national economy as a whole. The legal nature of a syndicated loan and agreement concluded by the syndicate members is revealed. The authors study the problem of slow development of syndicated lending to economic entities in modern Russia. It is noted that this financial technology has been used abroad for a long time and very successfully, while in the Russian Federation syndicated lending is considered to be an innovative banking product. It is concluded that this situation is due to the absence of the detailed legal regulation of this field of business relations, as well as the poor development of the mutual credit partnership among the commercial banks. However, the institution of syndicated lending enables to transact for the financial support of major innovative projects. The development of this institution will contribute to reducing the risks of the parties involved, as well as intensifying the syndicated lending in Russia. © 2017, by ASERS® Publishing.

Evidence from the Chinese peer-to-peer lending platform,2017.0,"China; Fintech, offline authentication; Information asymmetry; Listing outcomes; Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending","This paper explores how borrowers’ financial and personal information, loan characteristics and lending models affect peer-to-peer (P2P) loan funding outcomes. Using a large sample of listings from one of the largest Chinese online P2P lending platforms, we find that those borrowers earning a higher income or who own a car are more likely to receive a loan, pay lower interest rates, and are less likely to default. The credit grade assigned by the lending platform may not represent the creditworthiness of potential borrowers. We also find that the unique offline process in the Chinese P2P online lending platform exerts significant influence on the lending decision.

Given the scope, complexity, and dynamism of FinTech solutions, cyberattacks are inevitable, making enhanced security technology indispensable to ensuring future growth. Information leakage is one of the most common vulnerabilities and is still difficult to be prevented completely. The most promising approach to solving this problem is secure computation, which, thanks to its ability to process encrypted data, has proven to be a robust information leakage prevention technology. This paper discusses NEC's own contribution to Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC) technology. In SMPC, data on multiple machines can be processed while maintaining the security of the data on each machine. In addition to explaining the technology itself, we will show how it could work in FinTech applications by reviewing some case studies centering around NEC's high-speed method and protection of information for authentication.",Article,2-s2.0-85024829842

It uses a consensus mechanism, digital signature and hash chains to realize the reliable storage of ledgers, and provide services such as traceability, integrity and no-repudiation for transactions in ledgers in a decentralized way. These services make blockchain have great application potentiality in the fields of healthcare, Fintech, computational law and so on. Before wide spreading its applications, blockchain must solve problems such as efficiency and privacy. Among these problems the privacy is an important one. Because blocks on blockchain are open, when transactions in blocks involve privacy data, these data can be leaked. Thus, certain security mechanisms must be built to protect privacy data. The core of these mechanisms is the appropriate key management schemes. However, blockchain is a developing technology, and few studies have been done on key management schemes for it. Because healthcare is a big application scenario of blockchain, in this paper, according to the features of health blockchain, we use body sensor network to design a lightweight backup and efficient recovery scheme for keys of health blockchain. Analyses show that the scheme has high security and performance, and it can be used to protect privacy messages on health blockchain effectively and to promote the application of health blockchain. © 2017 IEEE.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85021437837

However, it is hard for online authentication technology based on traditional mode to maintain the healthy and stable development of mobile payment. Besides that, it can't meet the security demand of user's privacy or some sensitive information else. In this paper, we propose a secure mutual authentication protocol (SMAP) based on U2F for mobile payment. In this system, the asymmetric cryptosystem is used for mutual authentication between server and client to guarantee a reliable service, which is based on the architecture of U2F. It can resist disguise and dispose counterfeit user. Compared to the current existing modes, the proposed protocol strengthens the security of user's account information as well as individual privacy in whole transaction process with mobile payment.

Endeavours towards financial inclusion of the underserved SMEs could rationalize why we should allow for or encourage FinTech innovations exemplified by the online supply-chain financing mentioned above. What would be an adaptive regulatory regime for such innovative FinTech-enabled financial services as the online supply-chain financing? Within our conceptual framework to regulate the FinTech industry at the early stage, rather than rigorous rules traditionally placed on large financial institutions, a principles-based strategy should be adopted to strike a balance between financial stability and access to financial services advanced by disruptive innovations. As a necessary complement, regulatory sandboxes would be needed to spur a shift in institutional philosophy to a principles-based regulatory regime. In other words, the regulatory attitude of FinTech regulation should be humble and light-Touch to promote innovation for improving digital financial inclusion, albeit on the premise of containing potential systemic risk and protecting consumer interest in the meantime. © Cambridge University Press and KoGuan Law School, Shanghai Jiao Tong University.",Article,2-s2.0-85018160901
"Langley P., Leyshon A.",Capitalizing on the crowd: The monetary and financial ecologies of crowdfunding,2017.0,Crowdfunding; diverse economies; FinTech; monetary and financial ecologies; sharing economy,"‘Crowdfunding’ is a method of raising money and finance to capitalize projects of various kinds. Drawing on the networking capabilities of the internet and software platforms, those seeking project funding appeal to potentially diverse audiences who are collectively referred to as ‘the crowd’. What practitioners, advocates and policymakers typically identify within crowdfunding is its ‘alternative’, ‘disruptive’ and ‘democratizing’ qualities; that is, it is held to be a novel, digitally rendered economic space which has the capacity to challenge established funding practices in banking, capital markets and venture capital networks, offering a more open and egalitarian source of capital for economic, social and cultural entrepreneurship. The paper develops the concept of ‘ecologies’, drawn from the geographies of money and finance literature, to advance a critical understanding of the crowdfunding economy that is sceptical of its apparent qualities. First, by encouraging the analysis of diverse and proliferative monetary and financial forms, the concept of ecologies enables an understanding that avoids the binary opposition of ‘capitalist/alternative’ economic forms and which differentiates between the variegated crowdfunding ecologies that have emerged to date. Second, by foregrounding the intermediation processes and credit–debt relations of monetary and financial ecologies, it is argued that crowdfunding may largely replicate rather than disrupt the extant institutional and debt dynamics of funding practices. Third, by emphasizing the socio-spatial effects of monetary and financial ecologies, attention is drawn to the need for further research into the unevenness that mitigates against crowdfunding being as open and egalitarian as its advocates claim. © 2017, © The Author(s) 2017.",Article,2-s2.0-85018992527

Fintech is a new economic industry, comprised of companies that adopted the latest technologies to provide more efficient financial services than the traditional financial services. Fintech companies are generally small to medium sized startups trying to disintermediate existing financial systems. FinTech companies can be differentiated in several areas, based on its business solutions and target customers. In Korea, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) lending companies are the most prominent in the FinTech sector. P2P lending is a method of borrowing or lending money to individuals through online services without the use of an official financial institution as an intermediary. The P2P lending companies operate their services entirely online or mobile environment. Consequently, mobile P2P lending application users are dramatically increasing. Thus, it is worth evaluating the acceptance of the mobile apps of the P2P lending companies from a user’s perspective. This paper discusses user acceptance of the mobile P2P lending apps, guided by the Technology Acceptance Model. We conclude that the users’ acceptance of mobile P2P lending apps are significantly influenced by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and user satisfaction.

The consumption paradigm is changing; subsequently, an omni-channel has been introduced that empowers consumers to interact with firms through a myriad of touch points in multiple channels. This study is to understand the perceptions and behavioral characteristics of consumers in the purchase process (e.g., information search and purchase phase). A qualitative method was adopted for this study and data were collected through semi-structured in-depth interviews with 15 omni-channel consumers. The results of this study were as follows. At the information search stage, consistency was the most important consideration for consumers who also wanted to retain channel-specific benefits. Consumers also searched for differentiated information among distribution channels. At the purchase stage, participants choose a shopping channel according to shopping values. They utilized newly introduced services (e.g., ""online purchase, offline pick-up"", FinTech) that combine retail channels. Our findings provide significance in managing omni-channel services. First, it is recommended that fashion retailers provide seamlessly integrated experience to consumer and adopt a consumer-centered channel choice strategy. Second, fashion retailers must maintain a constant attitude toward shopping experience to fashion, such as shopping enjoyment and exclusiveness. © 2017, The Korean Society of Clothing and Textiles.",Article,2-s2.0-85030978975

It first relates the history of mathematics to the history of financial technologies, and argues, inspired by Simmel and Marcuse, that from ancient times to now there seems to be an evolution towards increasing quantification not only in finance, accounting etc., but in modern society in general. It shows that scientific and technological changes have social and ethical consequences, as quantification creates more distance between people. The paper then analyzes and discusses current shifts of financial agency that exemplify what seems to be a moment of hyper-quantification through the use of ICTs: experiences of “the market” as an independent agent and money machines as artificial agents in high frequency trading—perhaps the only agents still able to cope with the data-loaded and hyper-quantified world we live in. Under these conditions it becomes more difficult to exercise responsibility. The paper concludes that while we must acknowledge the human character of finance and mathematics, there are real human and social consequences of quantification, in ancient times and today, for society and responsibility. It is therefore misleading to assume that financial technologies and mathematics are ethically neutral; more analysis of ethical and societal aspects is needed, also from an “outside” perspective. © Springer International Publishing AG 2017.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85019686468

Many of them are exploring blockchain applications to their multiple business lines, focusing in particular on post trading activities. Potential benefits include the reduction in counterparty risk and post trading costs as well as the increase of liquidity and transparency. At current stage exchanges are mainly exploring the technology looking for proofs of concept, with the exception of some more advanced projects like at Nasdaq and ASX. The mass adoption will require longer efforts and is expected to come in a decade, at least. Fintech developments are receiving strong attention also by regulators and international organizations, given the potential of distributed ledger technology for both competition enhancement and cyber risk reduction.

Bunge D.,In the shadow of banking: Oversight of fintechs and their service companies,2017.0,Bitcoin; Financial technology; Technology service providers; Third-party service providers; Virtual currencies,"In the United States, the regulatory authority of government agencies over financial institutions’ third-party service providers varies depending on the type of financial institution. The Federal Depository Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB), and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) may extend their authority over service providers to their supervised institutions. Meanwhile, the National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) lacks this authority for credit unions. The federal and state agencies that oversee Money Service Businesses (MSBs) also lack this authority. The regulatory authority over MSBs service providers is particularly interesting because of the rise of virtual currency businesses providing an alternative payment rail outside of traditional institutions, allowing small fintech startups to enter into the payment space. This chapter examines federal and state authority over third-party service providers and justifications thereof. It goes on to examine some of the more unique aspects of fintech entrants to the payment space and how their service providers should be treated along with other MSBs. Ultimately, this chapter recommends that private contract law between MSBs and their service providers be used to mitigate the risks in their relationship. Limited resources and duplicative regulatory costs between federal and state agencies as well as the relatively small size of the industry makes it inefficient to directly supervise third-party service providers. However, this chapter does not reject the possibility of future extensions of government authority as the industry and its potential impact over the financial system grows. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd 2017.",Book Chapter,2-s2.0-85075900931

We draw from the concepts of sensing and responding to analyse more than 3000 news articles, webpages, reports, and press releases covering the period 2008-2017 related to four Australian Banks. Within the limitations of the method, our findings indicate that Australian Banks are actively embracing FinTech by creating mechanisms for inbound FinTech knowledge flows, monitoring and facilitating FinTech activities of start-ups, crowd-sourcing FinTech ideas, seeting up innovation hubs to encourage internal FinTech innovations, modernizing their platforms with the adoption of technologies commonly associated with startups, partnering, and investing in FinTech start-ups.

Our main findings can be grouped to three main areas: (1) the changing role of branches (2) online, mobile and phone-based services and (3) products and services. The compound of customers is quite heterogeneous in age, education or income status for all banks in our research, therefore, the possibility of generalization of problems and possible solutions is limited. A major challenge for banks is that they need to think up to 20-30 customer segments, and offer services with which can serve the needs of other segments – so generic enough to meet more segments' needs. Of course, the strategies of banks may differ in the targeted segments; however, banks with general strategy can be dominated by competitors concentrating on a niche strategy, or a FinTech, for example, with the widespread application of digital solutions. © 2017 University of Maribor Press.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-85061129223

In this study, we studied FinTech start-up firms. FinTech refers to a newly emerging industry and service fields through the fusion of finance and ICT. In this study, we studied on current status of FinTech firms. We deal with domestic firms such as Daum Kakao, LGU+. And we described In foreign firms such as Fidor Bank, Simple Online Bank, OnDeck, Stripe and Affirm. Eventually we analyzed problems of the current FinTech firms. In this study, we described several FinTech start-up firms. Many FinTech companies are especially in the payment sector. Two rapidly growing start-ups to notice for the recent five years are studied. A biggest hurdle in electrolyzation of financial service is personal information leakage therefore, biometrics to supplement it gains attention. According to gartner, bio authentication use ratio using mobile devices is forecast to grow from current 5-30%. However, damage may continue to one's life time if bio information leaks.

We argue that keeping them separate is a bad idea for FinTech “Decentralized Autonomous Organizations” (DAOs). In fact, security and economics are one for DAOs: we show that the failure of a security property, e.g. anonymity, can destroy a DAOs because economic attacks can be tailgated to security attacks. This is illustrated by the examples of “TheDAO” (built on the Ethereum platform) and the DAOed version of a Futures Exchange.

Relevant policy documents disclosed by the financial regulator on cybersecurity and pertinent issues are examined. Findings: Adopting a strategic approach that seizes opportunities associated with Fintech, the financial regulator harnesses comprehensive risk-based mechanisms to embrace exposures to cyber risks while promoting institutionalization of cybersecurity among the regulated firms with strategic controls. This study suggests a pathway for the evolution of a profession with both technical and ethical competence for mitigating the emerging risks arising from Fintech. However, such an approach is yet to be tested with respect to efficacy for the unexplored territories of fraud exposures, resulting from swift Fintech developments across borders. Research limitations/implications: As Fintech has only emerged rapidly in the recent years, it is not conclusive in this review of performance and effectiveness of the financial regulator in its strategic approach.

This study aims to identify the strategic considerations in the process of searching for FinTech investment targets. Case description: This study used a case study investigation of a top-5 bank in Taiwan. The major data sources include the meeting notes of the FinTech investment task force and interviews with the team members. Co-opetition theory was adopted as the theoretical framework and interview questions were derived from the PARTS strategies in co-petition theory. The results relate to: (1) the strategic goals of FinTech investment, (2) the added value from FinTech companies, (3) criteria in selecting candidates in the same FinTech area, (4) choosing to work as either a cooperator or a competitor, and (5) barriers from policies and regulations. Discussion and evaluation: This study has several findings: (1) regulations and policies shape FinTech’s development; (2) banks, technology companies, and customers are not “FinTech ready;” (3) Compare top-down with bottom up strategies; (4) banks and FinTech companies have complex relationships; (5) it is unlikely that Taiwan will produce FinTech disruptors in the near future. Conclusion: The findings and discussion can benefit researchers and administrators in finance-related industries. More studies are desired to observe long-term development in terms of how companies collaborate or compete in specific FinTech areas. © 2016, The Author(s).",Article,2-s2.0-85058395789

Particularly the emergence of new information technology and social media networks provide ample opportunities to leverage a massive amount of data for managerial purposes. However, managers still meet using social media with skepticism and it is not fully understood how to make use of this information for new product development. We introduce a new method on how to use large-scale internet data as a complement to traditional approaches (patent or publication analysis and surveys) to overcome their shortcomings in terms of speed, dynamic and expense to conduct. More specifically, we propose that social media communication of startups can give valuable indications about future product trends especially in rapidly developing fields. Our approach measures the awareness of startups - and their products - as the increase of the communication about the startup on Twitter. Startup communication is a particularly well-suited indicator because startups develop new-to-the-world products or are in the development process. We illustrate our approach by analysing the communication of 545 startups. On a holistic level we determine industry trends. Fintech is among the topics that increase significantly in relevance. We determine more specific categories within the industries by applying cosine-similarity metrics and hierarchical cluster analysis. Subsequently we determine NPD relevant trends by the increase of retweets within these categories. The growing customer awareness of these clusters shows newly evolving customer needs. Incumbents may use this information to adjust to their current portfolio or to find collaboration partners to best meet upcoming challenges and opportunities. We think that the approach can be transferred to a multitude of fields, helping with the analysis of emerging fields and with early stage opportunity recognition. © 2016 World Scientific Publishing Europe Ltd.",Conference Paper,2-s2.0-84996878191

To match borrowers’ supply of loan requests and customers’ investment demand, this article proposes that crowdlending platforms need to initiate double switching behavior. On the one hand, switching of enterprise borrowers from traditional bank financing to crowdlending is driven by greater convenience (speed, flexibility, simplicity) and process transparency. Consumers, on the other, predominantly invest in crowdlending loans based on their economic performance relative to the choice set on the platform.

"Volosovich S., Krivosheeva V.",Self-regulation of the credit services market for individuals,2016.0,Credit services market for individuals; Self-regulated organisations; Self-regulation; Self-regulation models,"Introduction. Relevance of the research is caused by the need to regulate relations between buyers and sellers on the credit services market, provide communication between the government and sellers of credit services and protect professional market participants from excessive state control. The purpose of the article is to design a classification for self-regulation of the credit services market to individuals and identify its features in Ukraine. Methods. The authors used methods of theoretical generalisation, comparison and system analysis. Results. Analytical, information, coordination and innovative functions are performed by self-regulated organisations in the credit services market. It is proposed to classify the self-regulation of credit services market by models, market sectors, area, and by participants. The authors have studied activities of the Association of Ukrainian Banks, the Independent Association of Banks of Ukraine, the Ukrainian Association of Credit Unions, the Ukrainian National Credit Union Association, the All-Ukrainian Association of Pawnshops, the Ukrainian Association of Credit Unions of Servicemen and Employees of Law Enforcement Agencies, the World Council of Credit Unions, the World Council of Ukrainian Cooperatives, the Ukrainian Professional Association for Protection of Investors, Creditors and Insurants and the Association for Consumer Protection with regard to self-regulated organisations providing financial services in the credit services market. In periods of growth, self-regulated organisations were presented by the associations of suppliers in Ukraine. In the period of crisis aggravation, self-regulated organisations appeared to be institutions that protected the rights of consumers of credit services. Conclusions. Thus, self-regulation is an important function of the credit services market and helps to strengthen the resilience to the external threats and protect the interests of both service suppliers and consumers. Self-regulated organisations in the credit services market in Ukraine do not provide regulatory functions. They are largely linked to the execution of representative, analytical and information functions. At the same time, the role of the innovative function of the national self-regulated organisations will increase in the future with regard to the activation of financial innovation and financial technologies in the international credit market. Prior to 2008, self-regulation of the credit services market in Ukraine was represented by associations of suppliers. In the period of acute crisis, self-regulated organisations have started to actively develop in the market. They were created by consumers of credit in order to protect their rights. © Institute of Society Transformation, 2016.",Article,2-s2.0-84976596451

Redmond M.,"From ""intrusive"" and ""excessive"" to financially abusive? Charitable and religious fund-raising amongst vulnerable older people",2016.0,Charitable fundraising; Financial abuse; Legal; Older people; Religious donations; Safeguarding,"Purpose: The purpose of this paper is to explore the nature of both charitable and religious fundraising amongst vulnerable older adults. It is a practice that is hidden and opaque. The circumstances surrounding the death of Olive Clarke in spring 2015, however, suggest that it is a practice that involves ""intrusive"" and ""excessive"" practices. Fundraising amongst vulnerable older adults is largely unregulated and independently monitored. This paper argues that ensuring the protection of vulnerable older adults requires substantial change and new accountabilities. Design/methodology/approach: This paper explores current approaches to financial abuse and the focus on family and professional carers as the main likely perpetrators. However, using literature from both the USA and Australia, it considers notions of ""trust"" and professional behaviour, and the way that vulnerable older adults are subject to new forms of abuse as a result of financial technology such as online and telephone banking. It links this with the practices of charitable fundraisers using techniques such as cold calling and direct mail. Findings: The circumstances surrounding the death of Olive Clarke suggest that charities, and those fundraise for charities appear to engage in a practice whereby they sell the names of likely donors to each other. This practice opens opportunities for abusive relationships to take place. At the same time many clergy operate like the single GP surgeries that allowed Shipman to practice unnoticed and unaccountable. The relationship between clergy and their aging congregation, who are relied upon to raise funds for church activities, open up the opportunity for abuse to take to place. Few records on charitable giving exist that permit regulation and independent scrutiny. Research limitations/implications: Current research in this area is limited by the focus on family and professional carers as likely perpetrators of financial abuse, and through attention on child sexual abuse in general. There is a lack of research on charitable giving, and the focus tends to be on altruism rather than the practices and motivations of fundraisers themselves. This paper intends to begin an academic debate to the context in which Olive Clarke took her own life. Practical implications: In the wake of the death of Olive Clarke the Fundraising Standards Board has been tasked with reviewing the way charities raise funds amongst vulnerable older adults. No one has yet used the language of financial abuse, choosing to opt for the terms ""excessive"" and ""intrusive"" there is a need to shift this debate and encourage greater regulation and accountability. Social implications: This paper seeks to explore how some of the organisations that are supposed to protect and care for vulnerable people engage in practices that exploit and abuse. It is timely as debates about charitable giving are beginning to increase, and the role of the church and the religious groups in the abuse of children is being considered by the new independent inquiry in the UK. It has significant implications for accountability, trust and regulation. Originality/value: The financial abuse of older adults is rarely considered outside of the family - carer nexus. However, changes in the banking and financial systems means that opportunities for abuse are greater than ever before. Prior to the death of Olive Clarke in spring 2015 very little attention on the nature of charitable and religious fundraising amongst older adults has taken place, and consequently this paper is highly original, but equally timely. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited.",Article,2-s2.0-84962773615

With a model of two-sided market with vertical restraints, we derive the following results. When only the entry of a vertically integrated (or end-to-end service) provider is allowed, either all merchants opt for multi-homing or no entry occurs, regardless of the regulatory requirement. On the other hand, if the entry of a downstream-only (or front-end service) provider is allowed, a partial multi-homing equilibrium could emerge under certain conditions, in which the entry of an end-to-end service provider does not occur. Without regulation, however, the vertically integrated incumbent does not voluntarily provide the back-end service to the entrant in general. This suggests the need for proper regulatory measures to reach a socially desirable outcome from the new entry in the retail payments market. © 2016 Korean Securities Association.",Article,2-s2.0-84966339680

These recent tendencies require the banks to increase investment in FinTech, rethink service distribution channels, especially the business-to-consumers models, increase further standardization of backoffice functions, etc. Some members of the financial services industry see the boom in FinTech as a threat to traditional banking industry. Others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility, better functionality in some areas, and aggregation of services. The aim of the paper is to analyze the recent trends in banking, identifying opportunities and risks of FinTech for banks. A timely integration of FinTech into business allows banks to get an advantage in growing competition. This paper provides an extensive analysis of recent trends in FinTech and banking, examining experience of leading European and US banks, as well as surveys conducted among members of the financial services industry in different countries. The authors have studied the development of the financial innovation and technology market, assessed the existing practices applied in the field of FinTech, identified the main risks related to development of FinTech and financial innovations the banks are exposed to on the micro- and macrolevel. The paper provides recommendations for regulators and banks to ensure reduction of risks associated with development of FinTech. Analysis of FinTech market has shown growing competition, including from nonfinancial institutions. The paper provides practical recommendations to commercial banks for strengthening the position in financial innovations and controlling the risks associated with introduction of financial innovations.

FIDO services are adapting a variety of service areas such as easy payment, money transfer, ATM withdrawal/savings, and single sign-on, etc. Because FIDO service uses standard public key cryptography techniques to provide stronger authentication and securely saves a user's bio-information in the smartphone. But when registered, FIDO only confirms the match between pre-enrolled fingerprints and the one on the registration process. In other words, FIDO is not able to verify the person's identity. The user has to register his/her biometric information in each sites. It is our purpose to solve these problems by implementing FIDO and PKI technologies adapted in current FIDO service and accredited certification system.

The international community has ambitious commitments in this regard, e.g. the UN's Sustainable Energy for All by 2030. But scholarship has not kept up with policy ambitions. This paper operationalises a sociotechnical transitions perspective to analyse for the first time the potential of new, mobileenabled, pay-as-you-go approaches to financing sustainable energy access, focussing on a case study of pay-as-you-go approaches to financing solar home systems in Kenya. The analysis calls into question the adequacy of the dominant, two-dimensional treatment of sustainable energy access in the literature as a purely financial/technology, economics/ engineering problem (which ignores sociocultural and political considerations) and demonstrates the value of a new research agenda that explicitly attends to theories of social change – even when, as in this paper, the focus is purely on finance. The paper demonstrates that sociocultural considerations cut across the literature's traditional two-dimensional analytic categories (technology and finance) and are material to the likely success of any technological or financial intervention. It also demonstrates that the alignment of new payas- you-go finance approaches with existing sociocultural practices of paying for energy can explain their early success and likely longevity relative to traditional finance approaches. © 2015, © The Author(s) 2015.",Article,2-s2.0-84950325673

Egorov D.G.,Subject of economic science,2015.0,Cost; Economics; Macroeconomics; Measurement; Microeconomics; Neo-classical theory; Value,"Adam Smith defined economics as ""the science of the nature and causes of the wealth of nations"" (implicitly appealing - in reference to the ""wealth"" - to the ""value""). Neo-classical theory views it as a science ""which studies human behavior in terms of the relationship between the objectives and the limited funds that may have a different use of"". The main reason that turns the neo-classical theory (that serves as the now prevailing economic mainstream) into a tool for manipulation of the public consciousness is the lack of measure (elimination of the ""value""). Even though the neo-classical definition of the subject of economics does not contain an explicit rejection of objective measures the reference to ""human behavior"" inevitably implies methodological subjectivism. This makes it necessary to adopt a principle of equilibrium: if you can not objectively (using a solid measurement) compare different states of the system, we can only postulate the existence of an equilibrium point to which the system tends. Neo-classical postulate of equilibrium can not explain the situation non-equilibrium. As a result, the neoclassical theory fails in matching microeconomics to macroeconomics. Moreover, a denial of the category ""value"" serves as a theoretical basis and an ideological prerequisite of now flourishing manipulative financial technologies. The author believes in the following two principal definitions: (1) economics is a science that studies the economic system, i.e. a system that creates and recombines value; (2) value is a measure of cost of the object. In our opinion, the value is the information cost measure. It should be added that a disclosure of the nature of this category is not an obligatory prerequisite of its introduction: methodologically, it is quite correct to postulate it a priori. The author concludes that the proposed definitions open the way not only to solve the problem of the measurement in economics, but also to address the issue of harmonizing macro- and microeconomics.",Review,2-s2.0-85002677975

This latter treatment, which we refer to as the ‘tools of coordination’ approach, sees technologies as mediators of market behavior that promote standardization and coordination. While this may be one important function of some technologies, taking a cultural approach to studying financial technologies highlights other important aspects of financial activity – in particular profit making. Instead of focusing primarily on how technologies coordinate market behavior, we focus on how technologies enable profit-making practices, in particular arbitrage. In two different case studies, one examining arbitrage between stock exchanges during the late nineteenth century and the other focusing on contemporary high-frequency trading, we employ the cultural approach to technology. We find that while new technologies do eventually promote greater coordination in financial markets, they are initially deployed for the opposite purpose, to produce what we call network differentials that allow some to profit at the expense of others. © 2015 Taylor & Francis.",Article,2-s2.0-84942365788

Recently, mobile field has drawn much attention and it is used for most means of living for users like purchase of commodity, payment, and user certification. The mobile economy also grows by this trend, but hacking accidents or financial crimes are also in full swing. It is expected that the service for mobile in the future will increase more than ever, but in security aspects we still useproblematic certification and security system. Data control service in the future is expected to do a lot with the service, which basically stores all services in phones as well as service providers through cloud service. Data control service will lead to the expansion of IoT (Internet of Things) service, as it substitutes existing off-line backup and safelyprovide user data regardless of location or kinds of devices. That is, users can use data from the devices connected to the Internet without copying or moving to devices users want to use. To use this data safely, establishing a certification system of users will be an ever more important factor. Therefore, this treatise is going to suggest the plan that we can conduct the certification in a safer way among several threats. In particular, mobile hacking is a very serious and important issue, as it could directly lead to monetary loss. When certification is insufficient, the possibility of a third party reaping benefits through hacking is greater. This treatise is going to suggest a model that service providers can provide safe certification service by performing verification of transaction and data through electronic certification.

These barriers are measured using human genetic distance from the technology frontier. The results based on cross-sectional data for 123 countries suggest that genetic distance to the global frontier has an economically and statistically significant effect on financial development, in that countries that are genetically far from the technology leader tend to have lower levels of financial development. Genetic distance is found to have the largest effect, even after controlling for other determinants of financial development established in the literature. These findings indicate that cultural barriers to the diffusion of financial technology across borders impact financial development by influencing the follower countries' ability to adopt and adapt innovations from the frontier. © 2013 Elsevier B.V.",Article,2-s2.0-84888394203

Specifically, Europe's innovation finance ecosystem lacks scale, plurality, and risk appetite. These problems could be addressed by new and creative approaches and technologies for financing dynamism in the economy, such as crowdfunding and general financial technology or ""FinTech"" innovation. However, these novel approaches may be held back by regulation that focuses on stability, avoiding forum shopping, and preventing fraud, to the exclusion of other interests, particularly ignoring innovation and renewal.

This article describes the impact and revolution of FinTech and Blockchain in the financial industry and demonstrates the main characteristics of such technology. Then, we present three critical challenges as well as three ethical issues about using Blockchain technology. Next, we discuss the development of Blockchain for the financial sector. In addition, we describe the real motivations for banks to explore Blockchain, and problems they face. In order to have a good understanding of the industry, a qualitative method was adopted, and sixteen experts were interviewed. It was identified that knowledge hiding in Blockchain was common and the rationale behind was analyzed using the TPB (Theory of Planned Behavior) approach. The analysis results suggested that knowledge hiding was due to affective, behavioral and cognitive evaluations. The interviewees also provided several recommendations and success factors to overcome current issues in Blockchain adoption. Therefore, four important propositions have been developed. Finally, this article suggests how financial services should respond to this new technology and how to manage knowledge sharing in a more structured way. This article contributes to the literature related to the current entrepreneurial finance landscape for Blockchain.",Article,WOS:000554927000043
"Hua, XP; Huang, YP","Understanding China's fintech sector: development, impacts and risks",2020.0,Financial technology; financial inclusion; financial stability; China,"Financial technology (fintech) is rapidly transforming the economy as well as the financial landscape in China. This paper attempts to shed light on its contributing factors, current state, economic impacts and potential risks. We identify three key drivers for China's fintech development, namely shortage of supply in formal financial market, strong government support for promoting financial inclusion through digital technology, and more 'tolerant' regulatory environment. The greatest value of the Chinese fintech sector is promotion of financial inclusion, enabling a vast number of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) and low-income households to access to financial services. Existing studies unveil some strong evidences of fintech development improving efficiency, increasing employment and supporting entrepreneurship. In the meantime, there are also serious challenges facing this sector, such as regulatory uncertainties, illegal transactions, data abuse, etc. We conclude the paper by presenting some key takeaways, including several lessons for financial regulation.",Article; Early Access,WOS:000563450200001

The subject aims at increasing the efficiency of existing processes and the institutional side of the industry is really interested. And in some ways, this is a breakthrough. This article elaborates on the current status quo and future path of the industry. Design/methodology/approach- The real estate industry is evolving, and parts of the business are increasingly being conquered by proptechs and fintechs. They have come into real estate to stay not because they discovered inefficiencies in the way one manages and does business with real estate, but because they come with an arsenal of new technologies that can change the whole game. The article discusses a path for changing the game in real estate. Findings - location, location, location has now evolved to data, data, data. However, there is one essential aspect that must be considered before the latter can become the real value creator: the ability of market players to analyse data.

Relying on distributed ledger technology (DLT, blockchain), the method of tokenization now seems to be the next way for digital economics to be actualised in practise. Digitalizing some of the production and selling processes through crypto-tokenization technology has brought with it new perspectives and opportunities. Any thorough consideration of the logic of distributed systems applied to economics is bound to see that it potentially brings considerable disruptions and significant changes in how companies get access to funding. Cryptocurrencies, and subsequently tokens initially issued from initial coin offerings (ICOs) have answered an obvious need for efficient, borderless, and secure flows of capital. This article first summarizes what early academic research tells us about ICOs based on DLTs and their factors of success. We then use the case of LakeDiamond, a Swiss venture in the business of growing and polishing synthetic diamonds, to present and contextualize the process of holding an ICO, which ultimately did not succeed. In the final section, we present two fund raising models that have recently gained traction and popularity, namely security token offerings (STOs) and initial exchange offerings (IEOs), and highlight their main advantages compared to ICOs.",Article,WOS:000546418900006

One case in this broader trend of postcolonial governance is India's Aadhaar and India Stack. This paper uses this case to explore how the in-sourcing of technology into means of governing, behind a front of participatory good governance, is contributing to the historical trajectory of citizenship regimes in India. Through claims of reducing financial leakages, Aadhaar, a biometric identification database consisting of fingerprint, iris scan, and photograph, has become compulsory for accessing welfare in India. The Indian government makes a case for Aadhaar using a propaganda discourse of its success, based on weak evidence. The India Stack, a set of cloud-based application programming interfaces (APIs) built on top of the Aadhaar database, offers a digital infrastructure for private companies to verify identities using Aadhaar data and to offer other services including financial services. The ability to access data, paired with a revolving door of individuals between state and corporations, points to an ulterior goal of both Aadhaar and the India Stack: creating winners in the corporate and financial technology sectors. The Indian corporate-state run through a governtrepreneurism uses Aadhaar and the India Stack as new digital technologies of governmentality to transform populations into subjects or customers.",Article,WOS:000534201500022

Following the 2008-09 crisis, China and other emerging markets and developing economies obtained formal membership in the forums of global financial regulatory governance. Has their incorporation changed global regulatory politics? We analyze the epistemic contestation, bargaining, and persuasion surrounding the latest item on the financial regulatory reform agenda of the G20 and the Financial Stability Board: non-bank credit intermediation. Our study identifies three groups of norm entrepreneurs with different epistemic backgrounds that advance partially overlapping and competing interpretative frames of how to define, understand, and regulate this amorphous financial (non-)sector. Regulators from Western advanced economies took the lead in defining non-bank finance as stability-threatening shadow banking, successfully asserting epistemic authority against alternative frames advanced by China and other developing countries that include developmental prerogatives. Confronted with this impasse, Chinese authorities have sought to re-frame non-bank finance at the G20 under the label of digital financial inclusion. Our findings challenge and refine salient theories of global regulatory politics and underscore the importance of epistemic concerns for debates over the consequences of the entry of new actors from the'Global South'into the core institutions of global financial governance.",Article; Early Access,WOS:000542418400001

To address these questions, the paper examines how the decision of the United Kingdom to leave the European Union has influenced the financial technology (FinTech) industry in London, applying data collected from in-depth interviews, covering different groups of stakeholders in London's FinTech industry, such as angel investors, banks, legal advisers, lobby organizations and private companies. Our results show that political uncertainty and the prospect of institutional change can trigger actor-level responses, which have the potential to modify the diversity as well as the local and non-local connectivity of an EE. Moreover, we demonstrate that the nature of strategic responses of entrepreneurial actors varies significantly, depending on their firms' characteristics, such as age, size, product specialization and the structure of their egocentric networks. With regard to the latter, our results show that anchor firms play an important role in other firms' egocentric networks and have the power to shape their strategic responses.",Article; Early Access,WOS:000533102200001

Despite multiple initiatives and regulatory changes, there is a need to revisit the reporting and regulatory frameworks and redefine the focus areas. Banks credit problem has often been explored under the lens of asymmetric information. Spreads are generally directly proportional to probability of default and an inverse function of collateral and security. However, in India, there is a noticeable gap in academic literature to suggest robust institutional reforms to address the twin curse of adverse selection and moral hazard. Regulatory frameworks, particularly with respect to risk management function of banks, also grapple with predicting forthcoming disruptions. As banks redesign their corporate customer experience on a digitalized scale, leveraging large-scale available data, there is a bigger challenge to the regulator to ensure risk regulations are effective and save costs as well. The authors suggest that if information asymmetry exists, the blockchain protocols may mitigate uncertainty. Though blockchain technology has been leveraged to increase effectiveness of certain corporate banking products, the originality of the paper lies in coming out with a detailed framework for the possible use of blockchain (a distributed ledger based technology) for credit decisions, timely generation of red-flags and tightening the regulatory framework. The paper also lists down suggestions to improve the enabling regulatory and reporting architecture using regulatory technology (RegTech) to support unification of data already available in the banking system. This will improve the quality of information available to the lenders and enable them to take more informed credit decisions (data-driven finance), while granting and monitoring loans.

"Gruin, J; Knaack, P",Not Just Another Shadow Bank: Chinese Authoritarian Capitalism and the 'Developmental' Promise of Digital Financial Innovation,2020.0,China; financial regulation; financial inclusion; fintech; institutional change; online lending; shadow banking,"China's financial system is rapidly evolving. Both the emergence of shadow banking since 2009 and the growth of fintech since 2013 as forms of 'non-bank credit intermediation' have catalysed market-oriented institutional change beyond the banking system, with potentially far-reaching economic and political implications. In this article we assess these developments in the broader trajectory of China's financial reform and economic development. Through an analysis of two key sectors of non-bank credit intermediation - wealth management products and online lending platforms - we find that the growth of both shadow banking and fintech can be located in the same trajectory of reform and development that has animated Chinese financial policy since the early 1990s. The toleration of WMPs and promotion of internet lending constitutes the latest stage of the Chinese Communist Party's efforts to construct a more efficient and sustainable market economy whilst simultaneously preserving political supremacy and custodianship of macro-social development. The difference in policy response is commensurate with the degree to which each financial sector meets the Party's twin objectives of economic development and political control. Counterintuitively from a Western liberal perspective, the very forces behind deep and broad financial liberalisation are also consolidating the Chinese Communist Party's overall legitimacy and ruling capacity.",Article,WOS:000523491200005

Nairobi is Kenya's largest and most developed city, but it is also the city where the country's largest slum is located. The city's poorest strata, the so-called urban poor, account for a large proportion of Nairobi's population; most of them face exclusion from accessing formal financial services. However, mobile money has enabled them to access financial services more easily. Based on survey research conducted by the author in Nairobi, this paper demonstrates that the urban poor were far less likely to have a bank account than middle- and high-income groups, but that they had a high need for saving services/safe money storage. Mobile money has provided a savings service that is better suited to the needs of the urban poor than that offered by other channels and has enabled them to save small amount of money more frequently. This has encouraged greater use of mobile money and has significantly decreased levels of financial exclusion amongst the urban poor (p< .001).",Article; Early Access,WOS:000540848000001

Because few of these workers are covered by employer-sponsored retirement plans, they often do not benefit from payroll deduction, employer matching contributions, automatic enrollment, and other provisions that encourage retirement saving. Better use of fintech, judicious changes to tax policy, and expanded Automatic IRAs would help independent workers save for retirement. In addition, we propose the creation of retirement saving accounts that attach to the worker as a supplement to, and possible replacement for, the current system of employer-sponsored accounts.",Article,WOS:000524925000003

"Saiz, A","Bricks, mortar, and proptech The economics of IT in brokerage, space utilization and commercial real estate finance",2020.0,IT; Fintech; Coworking; Future of real estate; Online brokerage; Proptech,"Purpose Digital and information technologies (IT) are becoming silently pervasive in old-fashioned real estate markets. This paper focuses on three important avenues for the diffusion of IT in commercial real estate: online brokerage and sales, the commoditization of space and Fintech in mortgage and equity funding. We describe the main new markets and products created by this IT revolution. The focus is on the pioneering US market, with some attention devoted to the specific firms and institutions taking these innovations into the mainstream. We also carefully analyze the economic underpinnings from which the new technologies can expect to generate cash flows, thus becoming viable-or not. Finally, we discuss their likely impact on established players in the commercial real estate arena. Design/methodology/approach In this paper, the author chooses to focus on three separate arenas where the IT revolution-sometimes referred to as Proptech, as applied to real estate-is having discernible impacts: sales and brokerage, space commoditization and online finance platforms. The author invites the reader to think seriously about the economic fundamentals that may-or may not-sustain new business models in Proptech. Real estate economists and investors alike need to be critical of new business models, especially when they are being aggressively marketed by their promoters. Trying to avoid any hype, the author provides thoughts about the likely impact of the innovations on their markets, guided by economic and finance theory, and previous experience. Findings The author evaluates the evolution of commercial real estate brokerage. While innovations will, no doubt, have an impact on the ways in which we buy and lease commercial properties, the lessons from the housing market should make us skeptical about the possibility of the new technologies dramatically facilitating disintermediation in this market. In fact, new oligopolies seem to be emerging with regard to market data provision. Practical implications - Proptech will change some aspects of the real estate industry, but not others! Originality/value As change pervades the property industry, only a relatively few research pieces are illustrating or-more importantly-providing insights about the likely economic and financial impacts of IT penetration. Similarly, only a few papers have so far addressed the economic viability of the alternative business models of tech startups targeting real estate markets and transactions.",Article,WOS:000521181600001
"Sannino, G; Di Carlo, F; Lucchese, M",CEO characteristics and sustainability business model in financial technologies firms Primary evidence from the utilization of innovative platforms,2020.0,CEO; Sustainability; Smart technologies; Sustainable business model; Platforms; Cultural drift; Fintech,"Purpose This paper aims to investigate and discover the demographic characteristics of corporate leaders (CEOs) in Fintech sector firms representing the implementation of the sustainable business model. Particularly, the purpose is to identify a benchmark profile of CEOs and to understand which are the main features (e.g. age, tenure, education specification, education level, gender, nationality, years of entrepreneurship, years in financial functions, years in IT functions), giving more opportunity to develop and maintain sustainable business models using innovative platforms. Design/methodology/approach The research questions are answered through a quali-quantitative methodology using descriptive and statistical approaches. The researchers collected a sample of 100 Fintech firms from the main Fintech firms in 2018 identified by the annual KPMG Report (2019). Thus, the research observed and tested the average level of the major CEO demographic features. Additionally, the paper explored whether these variables have a major probability to affect Fintech leading. Findings Assuming a relevant part of Fintech firms, the main results of this paper show the relevance of several CEO demographic characteristics. Additionally, the age, the tenure and the presence of an MBA are significant elements in affecting Leading companies. Originality/value The paper is novel because it contributes to the literature examining the internal governance and sustainable business model, still not explored. Moreover, this study contributes to identifying the CEO demographic characteristics that foster financial institutions' transition towards sustainable business models.",Article; Early Access,WOS:000524885500001

Design/methodology/approach A semi-structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 379 micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs), which use mobile money services drawn from the Northern District of Gulu in Uganda to provide responses for this study. The predictive relevancy and the effect size of the model were determined by running partial least square algorithm through structural equation model (SEM) with 5,000 bootstrap samples in SmartPLS-SEM 3.0. Findings The findings indicated that all the latent variables of transaction tax exemptions showed significant and positive impact on mobile money adoption and usage to advance financial inclusion in developing countries. Moreover, when combined together, the overall SEM predictive model revealed a significant moderating effect of transaction tax exemptions in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. This implies that transaction tax exemptions on digital financial innovations such as the mobile money services can stimulate economic growth through increased level of financial inclusion labeled as the main enabler in achieving the SDGs by the year 2030. Research limitations/implications Whereas data were collected from users of mobile money services, the samples were drawn specifically from MSMEs' owners located in the Northern District of Gulu in Uganda. Thus, users located in other districts were not included in the sample for this study. Similarly, this study limited itself to only financial services offered through the mobile money platform. It ignored other digital financial channels such as the internet and electronic banking. Practical implications Going forward, in order to improve the economic well-being of households at the bottom of the pyramid, governments in developing countries should embrace the significant role of transaction tax exemptions in promoting digital financial innovations such as the mobile money services for increased level of financial inclusion. The governments in developing countries where mobile money has greatly spurred financial inclusion should not only reduce the existing transaction taxes on mobile money services but scrap it off in order to champion progressive increase in the level of universal financial inclusion prescribed as a key enabler in eliminating global poverty, especially in developing countries. Originality/value This study hints on the moderating effect of transaction tax exemptions in the relationship between mobile money adoption and usage and financial inclusion. The paradox in the current trends on transaction taxes on mobile money services, especially in developing countries remain a dearth in the nascent global FINTECH ecosystem.",Article,WOS:000556877400001

"Bhatia, A; Chandani, A; Chhateja, J",Robo advisory and its potential in addressing the behavioral biases of investors - A qualitative study in Indian context,2020.0,Robo advisors; Artificial Intelligence; Behavioral biases; Fintech; Behavioral finance,"Technological developments have given shape to robotic services which have forayed in the finance and investment industry in the form of Robo-advisors. Robo-advisors are in use in the developed nations since over a decade but have recently entered the developing nations, like India, since early 2015. This research explores the present state of Robo-advisory services in the Indian context and investigates how Robo-advisors can help in mitigating behavioral biases of a retail investor. The present study gives an in-depth understanding about the ability of Robo-advisory to mitigate behavioral biases from the perspective of experts. These experts are from the product development team, quality control team, middleware, or at top management level from BFSI (Banking and Financial Services Industry), IT (Information Technology), FINTECH (Finance Technology) and NBFCs (Non-Banking Finance Companies) in India. The researchers have adopted a qualitative approach, of interviewing these experts, to discover the phenomenon and gain insight about Robo-advisory services. Each interview was recorded and transcribed on word-for-word basis. The transcribed content underwent a structured content analysis, using different categories, resulting from the conducted literature review. The intent is not to generalize the findings, since the field of Robo-advisory is at a nascent stage as far as Indian market is concerned. The key findings indicate that the current focus is to increase awareness level amongst investors, by educating them and by building trust. Our conclusion emphasizes the fact that Robo-advisors still need to mitigate investor's biases while performing risk analysis and profiling the investors. Robo-advisory platforms are not yet comprehensively self-sufficient to accurately perform risk analysis for retail investors. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.",Article,WOS:000528848600003

At present, there is no clear and authoritative definition of cryptocurrency, making it difficult for regulators to determine which aspects require regulation and, if so, how to control and monitor activities. Defining the legal nature of cryptocurrencies is important. At its most fundamental level the answer to these matters will determine the regulatory framework within which trading in cryptocurrencies may or may not occur. The government may simply prohibit trading in cryptocurrencies, even making such transactions illegal. Alternatively, trading may not only be legal, but facilitated by government concessions. A government may recognise cryptocurrencies as `currency'. It may be determined that transactions involving cryptocurrencies merely involve the sale of property, possibly akin to a financial product. This article discusses the different approaches to regulating cryptocurrency and the taxation implications in four Asian countries which account for a large proportion of cryptocurrency transactions.",Article,WOS:000528185700002

Due to the rapid change of information technologies and public financial needs, Internet finance has produced quite a few specific operation modes, which have interested many scholars. To better appreciate its development process and innovation modes, we used bibliometrics to analyze 2,877 articles on Internet finance in Web of Science. Through the co-word network, co-citation network and various results generated by CiteSpace, we recognized six main modes of Internet finance, that is, Internet bank, peer to peer lending (P2P lending), crowdfunding, big data finance, digital currency and fintech. Emerging research topics and the development history of each mode are also detected. We find that the mainstream modes in current research are P2P lending and crowdfunding and the research on fintech and digital currency has just begun. Through the review, we also suggest some research directions for the research direction of each mode. These results will help to deepen relevant scholars' understanding of Internet finance and provide guidance for them to choose research directions.",Review,WOS:000524337000005

This article provides an overview of the evolving ICO market and indicates the main advantages and risks of the ICO. It is pointed out that ICO offers many advantages, such as high liquidity, return on investment, availability, fast capital raising process, minimization of capital raising costs. Nonetheless, the noticeable benefits of ICOs are often available only when companies or investors agree to take considerable risks, caused by the information asymmetry, lack of investor protection, proper regulation and methodical guidance both for investors and entrepreneurs. Considering the novelty, volatility, emerging risks, growing popularity of the ICO market and the lack of research in the scientific literature, it is important to investigate the factors that influence the success of the ICO, which is usually defined as the amount of funds attracted, listing of the coins, return on investment, market capitalization or the duration of the ICO.",Article,WOS:000521104700003

The stated goal of the XS2A rule is to help an infant industry grow: that of Fintech payment services. However, mounting evidence suggests that unlike Fintech startups, big techs may benefit from the norm, putting a much stronger challenge to established banks. The latter indeed have less access to data about consumers' behavior (preferences, habits and conducts), less analytics capacity, and thus are placed in a competitive disadvantage by the XS2A, compared to their big tech rivals. According to many, that may result in competition harm and consumer welfare reduction in the medium and long run. The article revisits the rationales for introducing the XS2A rule by critically assessing its asserted goals (Part 1). It then suggests (Part 2) that to level the playing field among the market players involved and increase its overall proportionality, the norm be revisited. In the relationship between big tech and the banks, we propose to complement the XS2A rule with a reciprocity clause. Instead of free access to customers' account data, big tech would pay by counter-providing access to the behavioral data in their possession pertaining to the same customers concerned by the XS2A, and upon their consent. Data thus transmitted would only be available upon condition of reuse to increase the efficiency of the payment service provision. Reciprocity would greatly enhance data circulation among market participants, while fostering competition among them, creating incentives for more innovation and strengthening the overall proportionality of the XS2A rule.",Article,WOS:000519375800003

This paper examines the salient role of mobile payments in traditional banks' drive toward financial accessibility in sub-Sahara Africa by using panel econometric approaches that consider the issues of independencies among cross-sectional residuals. Using data from the World Development Index (WDI) 2011-2017 on 11 countries in the region, empirical results from cross-sectional dependence (CD) tests, panel unit root test, panel cointegration test, and the fully modified ordinary least squares (FMOLS) approach indicates that (i) the panel time series data are cross-sectionally independent, (ii) the variables have the same order of integration and are cointegrated, and (iii) growth in mobile payment transactions had a significant positive relationship with formal account ownership, the number of ATMs, and number of new bank branches in the long-run.

As a developing country, China's banking industry plays an important role in the financial industry, and its size ranks first in the world. Therefore, it is of great significance to study the systemic risks of China's banks in the digital economy era. We first compare the traditional indicator approach and the market-based approach theoretically, and Conditional Value at Risk (CoVaR) model, a market-based approach, is considered to be an efficient way to discover systemic risk in different perspectives. Based on static and dynamic models, we evaluate the contributions of sixteen China's listed banks to the systemic risk. Furthermore, we model bank exposures, extend the models by considering extreme circumstance, and incorporate the effects of Fintech and non-bank financial institutions. The results show the levels of systemic risks and the corresponding systemic importance rankings vary in different time periods. We find that the contributions of some small banks to systemic risk are even higher than some big banks during the sample period. Moreover, the big banks face less risks than most of the small banks when the banking system is in distress.

Design/methodology/approach A qualitative methodology based on an explorative single multi-unit case study strategy was used with individual and focus group interviews as primary sources of data collection. Perspectives of 22 individuals and three focus groups involving participants working in private, semi-government and government sectors that influence the economy of Bahrain were collected along with reports and articles published regarding those sectors as second sources of data compilation. Findings The preliminary findings show that Bahrain's pursuit of a KE has already begun by the government developing policies and regulations for the financial sector to innovate in financial technology (FinTech). It was also found that in order for innovation processes and products to be developed further in Bahrain, the government had to play a stronger role in promoting, facilitating and incentivizing those processes and developments. The role of the private sector emerged as the sole producer of innovation and the main entity responsible for producing innovative products and services that would inject direct values into the commercial economy of the innovation ecosystem. Originality/value This is the first study that examines the influence of collaboration between the government and the private sector on innovation development in Bahrain.

The products and services provided by the industry have been innovated, resulting in smart investment. Compared with traditional investment, smart investment as a new business model has the advantages of low threshold, low cost and high efficiency. However, as far as its nature is concerned, smart investment must first play the role of an investment adviser. Therefore, for enterprises or individuals who invest, the investment efficiency of smart investment is the most important. At present, the research on the efficiency analysis of smart investment, due to the improper selection of algorithm models or the lack of deep data mining, leads to the analysis of the investment efficiency of smart investment products is inconsistent with or even deviated from the actual situation. In view of these problems, this paper selects China Merchants Bank's Capricorn Intelligence as the research object, and analyzes the investment efficiency of smart investment based on K-means cluster analysis and data mining technology. The results show that Capricorn has a certain randomness in the selection process of the fund, and chooses to reduce the rate of return in order to control the risk. The investment portfolio formulated for the customer has obvious timing. The results show that the machine learning based on K-means algorithm makes a concrete analysis of the investment efficiency of Capricorn Smart Investment, this method can also be used for the efficiency analysis of other smart investment products.",Article,WOS:000562792400001
"Podrugina, AV; Tabakh, AV",Financial Markets: From the Tragedy of Commons to Balanced Regulation,2020.0,financial regulation; financial supervision; global governance; international financial architecture; financial regulatory failures; financial stability; systemic risk,"Nowadays the global financial system faces a triple challenge: the threat of a new systemic financial crisis at both global and regional levels; difficulties of constant adaptation of existing financial business and regulatory practices to intensive technological innovations; direct and hidden consequences of excessive political influence on the financial system through sanctions and selectively applied practices for sanction purposes. Improving the quality of financial regulation will require deeper cooperation between regulators of leading economies and a proactive position of the financial industry, as well as the decentralization of financial regulation. However, it is unlikely that this will happen at the global level. Financial stability became a key goal of global financial regulation in the post-crisis period. We consider financial stability as the tragedy of commons. The article describes the main trends of financial markets regulation after the crisis: transformation of global financial architecture, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorism financing practices (AML/CT), financial sanctions. The article analyzes the existing failures of modern post-crisis financial regulation: credit crunch, reduction in the effectiveness of monetary policy, regulatory arbitrage, and increased compliance costs (AML/CT legislation, tax legislation, and the sanctions regime). In the future we expect simultaneous trends of harmonization and standardization of requirements in traditional sectors of financial markets (including traditional institutions of the shadow banking sector), but at the same time regulatory arbitrage' will induce new financial technologies in order to reduce regulatory costs. The crisis triggered by the coronavirus pandemic in 2020 despite its non financial nature will almost inevitably have a major impact on financial markets and their regulation. Possible steps to eliminate failures in the financial regulation system are proposed, including recommendations for international organizations.",Article,WOS:000561668600008

One of the notable features of social trading is that this platform allows users to imitate the transactions conducted by other traders simply by following them. However, finding and following expert traders is the key challenge of social trading. To this end, systems and methods have been developed to rank traders. One of the drawbacks of the conventional methods is that there is no financial theory to support them. In this paper, a novel ranking method to discover expert traders based on the portfolio theory, is proposed. The experimental results obtained with a real dataset demonstrate that this method is superior to conventional methods. In addition, the discovered expert traders can be enlisted to develop better portfolio constructions for any given risk level.",Article,WOS:000560339000001

Among such initiatives, mobile-phone-enabled money transfer systems, or mobile money, have been particularly acclaimed for facilitating access to financial services and creating opportunities for the so-called unbanked poor. One of the first and most-discussed mobile money projects to date is M-Pesa in Kenya, a digital payment system which is now used by over 70 per cent of the Kenyan population across a variety of sectors including finance, commerce, education, health, and social welfare. M-Pesa is premised on a narrative of social entrepreneurship and has increasingly embraced the idea of philanthrocapitalism, promoting the logic that digital financial inclusion can simultaneously address social problems and produce profit. This paper brings together socio-legal enquiry and international political economy analysis to illustrate the institutional arrangements underpinning the development of M-Pesa and examine some of the projects built on its infrastructure. It argues that social entrepreneurship promotes a logic of opportunity rather than a politics of redistribution, favouring mobile money providers and the institutions involved in the mobile money social business over improving the lives of the intended beneficiaries, namely the unbanked poor.",Article,WOS:000555083800004

Regulatory sandboxes act as a pilot programme to regulate fintech services and products with several legal exemptions given to the service providers within established parameters. In 2016, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission and the Malaysian Central Bank followed the United Kingdom's Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) to introduce regulatory sandboxes within their legal framework. To date, previous literature has only provided a minimal analytical overview of the Malaysian and Australian regulatory sandbox. Hence, this article aims to fill that gap in literature. The methodology used for this study is both doctrinal and comparative legal analysis. The main objective of this study is to analyse the key characteristics of fintech regulatory sandboxes by comparing the Australian and Malaysian regulatory structures of these sandboxes. Due to nascent nature of Malaysian and Australian fintech regulations, this contributes to the growing knowledge in the financial regulation literature. Moreover, the findings on the operation of the regulatory sandboxes in both jurisdictions is expected to bring practical value for further research.",Article,WOS:000546216300001

"Pecaric, M; Peronja, I; Mostarac, M",Application of blockchain and smart contract tehnology in international payments - the case of reimbursement banks,2020.0,Blockchain/DLT; Smart Contract; Reimbursement Loan; International Payments,"The aim of this paper is to find alternative method of executing reimbursement loan, as a form of documentary loan, that is, to investigate new digital technology methods (fintech) to improve the efficiency of the international exchange. Reimbursement loans are often used to credit the trade of overseas goods. The reason of such case is that the shipment of goods by the maritime transport requires a significant amount of time and those trades are often associated with high financial amounts. Since international trade (exchange) is a kind of a generator of society's progress, it is necessary to explore the possibilities for making international payment cheaper, more efficient and more secure. In this case, we based our research on the implementation of modern technologies, more precisely blockchain/DLT (Distributed Ledger Technology) and smart contracts. The new reimbursement loan model presented in the paper is based on the aforementioned technologies. It could potentially change not only the documentary lending techniques, but also, eventually, overall financial paradigm. The effectiveness of the application of modern technologies is proven comparing the results of the so called conventional and unconventional reimbursement credit model on a real case involving two companies in Indonesia and Singapore. The paper also tackles on the further implementation of smart contract technology and blockchain/DLT, thus considering the potential impact of these technologies on overseas trade, credit markets and financial institutions. Finally, the paper argues on the limitations in implementing this new technique (e.g. legal, political and technical challenges).",Review,WOS:000546240400018

However, a generally accepted interpretation of digitalization has not yet been proposed.The paper discusses the distinctive features of the financial industry digitalization and uses them as a basis for offering a unified description of the nature of this transformation. The methodological framework is the notion of three types of innovation - technology, organization, and product. The research methods used in the article are analysis and synthesis. The paper demonstrates how the types of innovation determine the nature of the digital transformation of the financial industry and how they are manifested in various digital financial products. Digital transformation of finance includes two aspects: (a) Fintech revolution, i.e. technological companies entering the financial market, and (b) adoption of innovative digital technologies by traditional financial companies. We propose the 4U model to describe the marketing aspect of the financial industry digital transformation and introduce the concept of flexible finance as a way to provide financial services that suggest lower liability of financial institutions. The research results show that, firstly, digital transformation of the financial industry is not limited to the technological aspect but also includes organizational and product-related elements. Secondly, the trends in the financial industry digitalization are similar to those in the digital transformation of the global economy.",Article,WOS:000546559400006

To identify them, we used the scenario approach. We determined three main development scenarios for the market of innovative financial technologies - domination of traditional financial companies, segmentation of market of new financial technologies', and domination of digital financial companies in terms of their probability and possible consequences for the global financial markets. The results of analysis allowed us to suggest that among main scenarios of fintech development the most probable is the splitting of existing market, which in the future can turn into a market of digital transnational financial corporations, which will squeeze out both small companies and traditional financial giants. However, although the scenario of capturing the financial market by large players is currently unlikely, it is certainly more important in terms of the consequences for global markets. The main prerequisite for the latter scenario is the promotion of international cooperation in the regulation of digital financial companies. Such a condition requires new models of country-level interaction in the regulation of innovative financial companies in order to address the risks and challenges of different scenarios of fintech development on global financial markets. This article includes a comparative analysis of digital development in Russia and the Republic of Korea, which is one of the key players on the Asian fintech market, as a possible benchmark that can be used to shape the policies of intergovernmental cooperation on global financial markets. These policies include 1) regulatory cooperation that reduces risks due to growing experience in the regulation of innovative financial companies; 2)cooperation in investments that allow one to acquire additional experience in regulatory practices and to develop infrastructure, which meets the new requirements of digital finance; and 3) cooperation in the taxation of fintech companies that reduces cross-border regulatory arbitrage.",Article,WOS:000540649500002
"Glavee-Geo, R; Shaikh, AA; Karjaluoto, H; Hinson, RE",Drivers and outcomes of consumer engagement Insights from mobile money usage in Ghana,2020.0,Ghana; Consumer behaviour; Continuous usage; Consumer engagement; Mobile money,"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to examine the drivers of consumer engagement and its consequences via the experiences of mobile money services' users in Ghana and to discuss its implications for the society, financial service innovation, delivery and operations. Design/methodology/approach - A pre-tested survey instrument was used with a sample of 595 mobile money services users in Ghana. SmartPLS application was used to analyze the data and report findings. Findings - The study shows that perceived risk, consumer empowerment, subjective norm, performance expectancy and effort expectancy influence the affect component of consumer engagement and explain around half of its variance. The effect of perceived risk on consumer engagement was counterintuitive. Perceived risk was significant and positive for cognitive processing, whereas the effect was significant but negative for affect. The authors found support for the positive effect of cognitive processing on advocacy intention but no support for its effect on continuous usage. By contrast, affect strongly influenced both advocacy intention and continuous usage of mobile money services. Practical implications - The authors highlight the implications of mobile money services to business and marketing/service managers, policy makers, non-banking entities (such as telecoms and financial technology firms) and to the society in general. The authors provide important insights into how service providers can manage consumer engagement process and formulate marketing strategies to target and promote this simple, but innovative service to consumers. Moreover, the authors discuss the societal implications of the study in Ghana, a developing country. The authors recommend several options for future studies in order to stimulate the research agenda on mobile financial services in general. Originality/value - The present study shows that although mobile money was initially introduced to help consumers who hitherto have no access to formal banking services, this form of banking has become increasingly popular among various consumer segments as its usage and adoption has increased multifold largely in emerging and developing countries. The main contribution of this study is the development and testing of the mobile money customer engagement model. Moreover, this study shows the key factors that influence the engagement process and the effects of these factors as analyzed within the context of a developing country.",Article,WOS:000534501300001

Problem: Despite that the financial institutions are relying on the credit scoring patterns for analyzing the credit worthiness of the clients, still there are many factors that are imminent for improvement in the credit score evaluation patterns. There is need for improving the pattern to enhance the quality of analysis. Objective: Machine learning is offering immense potential in Fintech space and determining a personal credit score. Organizations by applying deep learning and machine learning techniques can tap individuals who are not being serviced by traditional financial institutions. Methodology: One of the major insights into the system is that the traditional models of banking intelligence solutions are predominantly the programmed models that can align with the information and banking systems that are used by the banks. But in the case of the machine-learning models that rely on algorithmic systems require more integral computation which is intrinsic. Hence, it can be advocated that the models usually need to have some decision lines wherein the dynamic calibration model must be streamlined. Such structure demands the dynamic calibration to have a decision tree system to empower with more integrated model changes. Results: The test analysis of the proposed machine learning model indicates effective and enhanced analysis process compared to the non-machine learning solutions. The model in terms of using various classifiers indicate potential ways in which the solution can be significant. Conclusion: If the systems can be developed to align with more pragmatic terms for analysis, it can help in improving the process conditions of customer profile analysis, wherein the process models have to be developed for comprehensive analysis and the ones that can make a sustainable solution for the credit system management. Originality: The proposed solution is effective and the one conceptualized to improve the credit scoring system patterns. If the model can be improved with more effective parameters and learning metrics, it can be sustainable outcome. Limitations: The model is tested in isolation and not in comparison to any of the existing credit scoring patterns. Only the inputs in terms of shortcomings from the existing models are taken in to account and accordingly the proposed solution is developed.",Review,WOS:000520032400011

In the meantime, the FinTech market, created by the convergence of financial and ICT areas, is emerging and growing rapidly. The new market of virtual transaction based on digital money is growing faster than any other FinTech area. The purpose of this study is to determine whether the perceived difference in the virtuality of a consumer's transaction affects the consumer's purchasing behavior and how the behavior changes. Specifically, this study revealed that consumers' perceived virtuality differs according to the type of transaction method. Consumers felt that the money was more virtual when they had digital (virtual) currency for a service than when they had cash. This virtuality of money controls the psychological distance of the consumer's money, which is closer to cash than virtual currency. This difference in psychological distance affects consumers' information processing, such that when psychological distances are far (vs. close), consumers prefer products that are described",Article,WOS:000508186400090

The prevailing belief is that digital banking has several advantages, such as lower costs and higher information transferability for customers. These benefits can also promote competition between banks given customers' predilection for multi-homing, or engagement with multiple banks. This study investigated the impact of customers' digital banking adoption on hidden defection, in which customers purchase financial products from competing banks instead of their primary banks. To this end, we developed an analytical model to provide insights into the effects of digital banking adoption while taking customers' multi-homing behaviors into consideration. We then conducted a series of empirical analyses using comprehensive individual-level transaction data to provide evidence of hidden defection. Our findings indicate that customers with higher loyalty exhibit greater hidden defection after digital banking adoption. Customers who engage primarily with personal-service channels (e.g., branches) show stronger hidden defection than do self-service channel (e.g., ATMs) users, and this effect is more prevalent among loyal customers. Our results provide valuable implications for omni-channel services in a market characterized by multi-homing behavior of customers.",Article,WOS:000496781100001

With the emergence of FinTech, which, with respect to the banking sector, is merging high-tech with the k-economy, there is an emerging need to highlight the importance and understand the dynamics of bank IC. With respect to Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) economies, where FinTech has become de rigueur, banking is bifurcated into Islamic and banking sectors. Through comparative empirical analysis, the purpose of this paper is to examine IC efficiency in Islamic and conventional banks with a view to elucidating the impact of IC, in aggregate and decomposed into its components, on an operational, financial and market performance of Islamic banks juxtaposed with conventional banks. Design/methodology/approach Using data collected from 59 banks for five years (2012-2016) involving 295 observations, an independent variable derived from the modified value added IC (MVAIC) components are regressed against dependent bank performance indicator variables [Return on Assets (ROA), Return on Equity (ROE) and Tobin's Q (TQ)]. Two types of control variables complete the regression analysis in this study: bank-specific and macroeconomic. Findings The findings elicited from the empirical results demonstrate that there is positive relationship between IC efficiency and financial performance (ROE) and market performance (TQ) in Islamic banks. In conventional banks, however, there is a positive relationship between IC and operational performance (ROE) and financial performance (ROE). Originality/value The model in this paper presents a valuable analytical framework for exploring IC efficiency as a driver of performance in dual-sector banking economies characterized by co-existence of Islamic and conventional financial institutions. In addition, this paper highlights bank management lacunae manifesting in terms of the weak nexus between: IC and asset efficiency (ROA) in Islamic banks and IC and market value (TQ) in conventional banks.",Article,WOS:000501139900007

It is important to predict whether a borrower can repay because the lenders must bear the credit risk when the borrower defaults, but it is difficult to design feature extractors with very complex information about borrowers and loan products. In this paper, we present an architecture of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) for predicting the repayment in P2P social lending to extract features automatically and improve the performance. CNN is a deep learning model for classifying complex data, which extracts discriminative features automatically by convolution operation on lending data. We classify the borrower's loan status by capturing the robust features and learning the patterns. Experimental results with 5-fold cross-validation show that our method automatically extracts complex features and is effective in repayment prediction on Lending Club data. In comparison with other machine learning methods, the standard CNN has achieved the highest performance with 75.86%. Exploiting various CNN models such as Inception, ResNet, and Inception-ResNet results in the state-of-the-art performance of 77.78%.

In this study, based on the weighted least squares (WLS) and threshold regression methods of cross-sectional data, we empirically examine the impact of FinTech development on agricultural nonpoint source (NPS) pollution, a major cause of impaired surface water quality. Our results show that there is an inverted U shape relationship between the development of FinTech and agricultural NPS pollution. That is, after crossing a threshold value, the level of FinTech development can curb agricultural NPS pollution. At the structural level, the availability of FinTech services, the FinTech infrastructure, and the agricultural NPS pollution also have an inverted U shape relationship. At the threshold effect, in the developing stage of an agricultural economy, the overall level of FinTech development, the use of FinTech services, the availability of FinTech services, and the FinTech infrastructure have an inverted U shape relationship with agricultural NPS pollution. On the other hand, in the developed stage of an agricultural economy, the impact of FinTech development and its structure on agricultural NPS pollution is insignificant. Hence, we can conclude that FinTech development can help reduce agricultural NPS pollution in under-developed regions. However, due to the fact that a U shape relationship always exists between FinTech service quality and agricultural NPS pollution, the quality of FinTech service should be the main focus to reduce agricultural NPS pollution more effectively.",Article,WOS:000502057400037

Yet, research is largely silent on how managers explain such changes and justify their ventures in the wake of fundamental redirections in strategy. Ventures initially attain legitimacy and amass resources on the strength of aims that audiences find compelling; later, those early claims can complicate course corrections. To shed light on how ventures manage strategic reorientations, we conducted an inductive, comparative case study of ventures in a nascent financial-technology sector. The ventures pursued parallel reorientations and produced comparable end products but diverged conspicuously in managing audiences during transitions. Our process model, inspired by these differences, proposes a sequence of stratagems that may enable entrepreneurs to alter strategy while portraying faithfulness to enduring aims.

The purpose of this paper is to examine the value of utilizing a neural networks (NNs) approach using mergers and acquisition (M&A) data confined in the US technology domain. Design/methodology/approach Using data from Bloomberg for the period 2000-2016, the results confirm that an NN approach provides more explanation between financial variables in the model than a traditional regression model where the NN approach of this study is then compared with linear classifier, logistic regression. The empirical results show that NN is a promising method of evaluating M&A takeover targets in terms of their predictive accuracy and adaptability. Findings The findings emphasize the value alternative methodologies provide in high-technology industries in order to achieve the screening and explorative performance objectives, given the technological complexity, market uncertainty and the divergent skill sets required for breakthrough innovations in these sectors. Research limitations/implications - NN methods do not provide for a fuller analysis of significance for each of the autonomous variables in the model as traditional regression methods do. The generalization breadth of this study is limited within a specific sector (technology) in a specific country (USA) covering a specific period (2000-2016). Practical implications - Investors value firms before investing in them to identify their true stock price; yet, technology firms pose a great valuation challenge to investors and analysts alike as the latest information technology stock price bubbles, Silicon Valley and as the recent stratospheric rise of financial technology companies have also demonstrated. Social implications - Numerous studies have shown that M&As are more often than not destroy value rather than create it. More than 50 percent of all M&As lead to a decline in relative total shareholder return after one year. Hence, effective target identification must be built on the foundation of a credible strategy that identifies the most promising market segments for growth, assesses whether organic or acquisitive growth is the best way forward and defines the commercial and financial hurdles for potential deals. Originality/value Technology firm value is directly dependent on growth, consequently most of the value will originate from future customers or products not from current assets that makes it challenging for investors to measure a firm's beta (risk) where the value of a technology is only known after its commercialization to the market. A differentiated methodological approach used is the use of NNs, machine learning and data mining to predict bankruptcy or takeover targets.",Article,WOS:000495693400007

To analyze the role of fintech in the national economy, we first broaden its definition and compare its economic performance using three methodologies-Demand-driven model, Supply-driven model and industry linkage effect in interindustry analysis. We find that the fintech industry has a stronger effect on production inducement. Regarding industry linkage effects, fintech ranked the top in all 31 industries for the forward linkage effect and 22 for the background linkage effect-much higher than the traditional financial industry. This implies that the fintech industry is effective as the intermediate good with national demand as well as the final good. Particularly, this industry plays the roles of intermediate and final goods across almost all industries. That is, fintech could better promote overall national economic performance as a platform industry. Because most businesses within the fintech industry depend on innovation through the integration of finance and information technology, we find that fintech can feasibly prompt the fourth industrial revolution. Nonetheless, this industry is characterized by excessive regulations in Korea, indicating the need for negative regulation for new, innovative businesses within the fintech industry that would critically emphasize innovativeness for inclusive, sustainable economic growth.",Article,WOS:000493525500210

Originality/value This study adds to the existing body of trust literature by investigating the direct effects of trust in service and structure assurance on continuance intention and how these two levels of trust are developed from technical and social aspects. It generates interesting insights into customers' continuance behavior of FinTech services.",Article,WOS:000487074800004
"Siciliani, P",The Disruption of the Prudential Regulatory Framework,2019.0,prudential regulation; regtech; suptech; fintech credit,"This article first explores how the prudential regulatory framework may be drastically changed as a result of the adoption of regtech and suptech innovations. The adoption of a shared data architecture, whereby the regulator is provided with seamless access to the accounts of regulated firms, may result in the development of a centralized approach to regulatory modelling, thus bypassing the existing partition between internal models and standardized approaches. Secondly, this article discusses how, thanks to the adoption of advanced predictive analytics, non-bank fintech lenders can gain insights into borrowers' creditworthiness irrespective of banks' control over traditional sources of information for credit scoring. This, though, may give rise to a new type of strategic gaming, this time by borrowers keen to maximize their chances of being granted a loan. In any case, preventing banks from adopting these new methods for the purpose of regulatory modelling might weaken their competitiveness. Thirdly, this article explores whether the transition to a centralized approach for credit risk management would conflate the distinction between microprudential and macroprudential interventions, in particular with respect to the countercyclical macroprudential policy. Finally, the article argues that non-bank (fintech) firms could be persuaded to coalesce behind endorsement of the new regulatory shared data platform in return for the support from the central bank. In this way, the regulatory perimeter could be extended in order to steer the adoption of financial innovations in a manner that benefits society overall.",Article,WOS:000511139300004

However, most research regarding the robo-advisor has focused on its development issues such as performance improvement and regulation, while limited research has paid attention to trust. This research extends the literature by investigating the trust influencing mechanism of robo-advisors by a mixed method approach. Specifically, we identified six salient trust influencing factors by qualitative interviews and proposed the research model based on trust transfer theory. This model was tested via a survey of 230 investors. Our study finds the significant influencing role of supervisory control and validates the relationships among trust influencing factors, trust in technologies, trust in vendor and trust in robo-advisor. Moreover, several differences between junior investors and senior investors are also found in our research.

Blockchain offers a secure validation mechanism and decentralized mass collaboration. Cryptocurrencies make use of this technology as a new asset class for investors worldwide. Cryptocurrencies are being used by companies to raise capital via initial coin offerings (ICOs). The substantial inflow of unregulated capital into a transactional and transnational industry has aroused interest from not just investors, but also national securities and monetary regulatory agencies. In this paper, we review the Security and Exchange Commission's initial statements and subsequent pronouncements on ICO's to illustrate the potential problems with applying an older legal framework to an ever-evolving ecosystem. Recognizing the inability of enforcement within existing regulatory frameworks, we discuss the importance of regulation of the crypto asset class and internal collaboration between government agencies and developers in the establishment of an ecosystem that integrates investor protection and investments.",Article,WOS:000487963000039
"Klimontowicz, M",THE ROLE OF BANKS' INNOVATIVENESS IN BUILDING SUSTAINABLE EFFICIENCY: THE CASE OF POLAND,2019.0,banks' innovativeness; competitive advantage; knowledge-based intangibles; financial technology; banks' efficiency; market performance,"New technology has already influenced almost all aspect of human life. Innovativeness is considered as one of the most important requirements for both companies and employees. Even such traditional entities like banks should develop their propensity and ability to incorporate changes in business practices through the creation and adoption of new ideas, solutions, and technology. Today, as a result of significant changes on banking markets, the innovativeness becomes one of the condition for banks' sustainability. Strong competition increased by a necessity to compete with new market players requires developing new managers and employees' skills as creativity and intrapreneurship. The purpose of the paper is to investigate to what extent bank's innovativeness impacts a bank's efficiency that lead to sustainable market position. It presents banks' innovativeness among other competitive advantage factors, their assessment from the perspective of their potential in the process of building bank's competitive advantage and a correlation between the level of bank's innovativeness and market efficiency. The majority of the innovativeness research concentrate on developed countries and very little is known about developing, transition countries. Moreover, the few of them explore banks as a specific entity. On the banking market, they focus rather on distribution channels or product innovations. To the best authors' knowledge, this is the first attempt to empirically examine the relationship between a bank's innovativeness and market efficiency in a transition banking market in Europe. The paper uses data retrieved from the research survey. The survey's target group consisted of all retail banks operating in Poland defined as banks that offer a broad range of financial services to different segments of individual customers. The research was conducted under the auspices of the Polish Banks Association. The data was collected by two methods - PAPI (personal and pencil interviews) and CAWI (computer assisted web interviews). The questionnaire was applied to executive managers of retail banks operating on Polish banking market and banks' customers. The data used for assessing banks' efficiency were derived from banks' annual reports. The results provide direction for banks' decision makers concerning innovativeness' factors that should be taken into account in the process of building competitive advantage and sustainable market performance.",Article,WOS:000483355000037

This is because the novel innovations of cryptocurrencies operate beyond the realm of the banking system, which may impact the performance of banks and their deposits variability. This study aims to investigate the long- and short-run effects of cryptocurrencies' market capitalization development on the banks' deposit variability in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. Design/methodology/approach In this study, the Johansen-Juselius (1990) cointegration test with vector error correction model was applied to examine the long-run relationships, while the Engle and Granger (1987) and the Granger (1969) causality tests were used to detect causal relationships in the short term. Findings The findings of Johansen-Juselius cointegration test indicate that the banks' deposits variability in all six states of the Gulf region share negative long-run equilibrium association with the development of global cryptocurrencies market capitalization, but with different statistically significant levels. For the short-run analysis, the study found that the development of cryptocurrencies market capitalization has significant unidirectional causal effects on bank deposits variabilities in only four states, namely, UAE, Qatar, Kuwait and Bahrain. The findings of the study therefore suggest that to eradicate the effects of cryptocurrencies industry and its threats to the banking industry, banks in GCC region are encouraged to either consider cryptocurrencies as an alternative investment asset for their portfolio investment diversification strategies or adopt the blockchain technology in their operation system to facilitate their customers with low transaction cost, high level of security and ease of use and real-time settlement. Originality/value This is a pioneering study that empirically explores the phenomenon of bank deposits variability as a consequence of expansion in cryptocurrencies market capitalization, where the findings proved evidence of a drastic decline in banks' deposits size due to the substantial growth in cryptocurrencies market capitalization.",Article,WOS:000526911700001

It is argued that situating this emergent 'turn to technology' in the context of a longer-running pattern of failed efforts to promote the development of financial markets for the poor in the Global South offers us a useful lens on the dynamics of neoliberalism. The article develops this analysis by drawing together interlinked discussions of 'neoliberal reason', highlighting the central role played by the diffusion of market institutions in neoliberal projects with Marxian discussions highlighting the crucial underlying role of labour in enabling the operation of markets. In this context the appeal to ever-more fine-grained information with which to allocate credit underlying the turn to technology can both be read as yet another attempt to 're-engineer' the market, and also seen as a doomed project. Empirically, this argument is fleshed out through an engagement with key framework documents around financial inclusion and technology from the World Bank and G20.",Article,WOS:000474953000001

In this article, we investigate the impact factors that subject-matter experts consider most important to the success of FinTech payment models. The data and their responses are evaluated through the lens of Christensen's market-creation theory, which contends that the adoption of market-creating innovations by a mass swathe of heretofore non-consumers pulls framework conditions into place, including missing infrastructure and enabling regulation. Then, we compare the findings with the literature and three case studies of mobile money adoption in Kenya, South Africa, and Nigeria. This study addresses a gap in the literature regarding the payment and money transfer segment of FinTech innovations in Africa using a multiple case study methodology. We drew together information from multiple sources, including semi-structured interviews, archival data in the form of industry and regulatory reports, and observational field notes. Our findings suggest that enabling environments (Kenya) do jumpstart adoption and difficult frameworks (Nigeria) do evolve.

Building on insights developed in Science and Technology Studies (STS), we argue that tracing the ways in which infrastructures enabling financial markets to operate are assembled out of multiple old and new socio-technical devices offers productive avenues for addressing key questions arising from several entanglements underpinning technological change. The findings of contributions to this special issue are linked to two key themes in debates on the impacts of technological change: financial inclusion and financial stability.

Sufficient information on the interplay between sector policies and the causes, impacts and response to climate change is relevant for developing sustainable climate change response plans. Using the agriculture sector as a case, this paper examines this interplay in the context of the humid forest zone (HFZ) of Cameroon. Drawing on secondary information from agriculture sector strategies, forest cover change, climate vulnerability and agriculture systems in the HFZ, we found that: (i) the objectives of agriculture expansion and avoided deforestation and forest degradation are at cross-roads; (ii) agriculture as a livelihood strategy is vulnerable to climate variability and change; (iii) strengthening agriculture production systems technically, materially and financially are main suggestions for climate resilient and low carbon emission agriculture practices. We highlight barriers that need to be addressed for the agriculture intensification mechanism, i.e. the agriculture research and extension services in Cameroon to respond to the needs of adaptation and carbon emission reductions from avoided deforestation. These barriers and others would be addressed if their financial, technology and capacity building needs are carefully evaluated as Cameroon mobilizes resources for the implementation of its National Determined Contributions.",Article,WOS:000472499300001

The rapid development of the digital economy at the national and worldwide levels in recent decades has accelerated processes of transformation of financial systems and led to financialiation of the global economy. FinTech companies operating in the financial market represent a new, quite special category of parabank institutions. They are characterised by the implementation of modern technologies to develop and provide traditional financial services. It would not be possible to provide such services without the Internet and digitalisation, compatibility of electronic devices, including hardware and software, nor would it become possible without new experiences, skills and consumer confidence. This is a kind of analogy with search engines that have changed the architecture of the market and mediation and led to the transformation of business models of financial market entities, in particular banks. Purpose. This paper presents the results of the possibility of providing financial services without banks. It determines the main aspects of competition and directions of combining FinTech and banking. Methods. In evaluation the FinTech and banking sectors, the authors have used statistical monitoring, as well as dynamic, comparative and structural analysis. Results. The results of the study show that FinTech allows creating new services that are not provided by traditional financial intermediaries. It has been proven that the limits for FinTech companies to avoid banking rules and regulations are expanding, and it is becoming increasingly difficult to prove that this is happening beyond the law or outside the law. An analysis of the global trends in the development of the FinTech industry has shown that the volume of investments in this area in 2018 was USD 111.8 billion, which is almost 6 times more than in 2013. The authors examine the main forms of interaction between banks and FinTech companies. Basic models of banks' participation in the creation of FinTech companies are substantiated. The authors of the article have analysed characteristics of the largest FinTech accelerators, identified and characterised the main risks and opportunities relating to FinTech for the banking and consumer sectors. Conclusions. The presented paper reveals the modern trends in FinTech development. They should be taken into account in defining the key determinants of the transformation of the banking sector in relation to the formation of new business models of banks with regard to the challenges of digitalisation.",Article,WOS:000486362700009
"Thompson, R",Underground banking and Myanmar's changing hundi system,2019.0,Myanmar; Burma; AML; CFT; Hundi; Informal value transfer system; Money laundering and terrorist financing,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to examine Myanmar's hundi system, an informal value transfer system used widely by local Myanmar citizens and offshore migrant workers to remit money domestically and internationally. Due to historically stringent banking and foreign exchange controls and a lack of domestic and internationally linked financial services, the system grew to become the dominant medium for remittances in Myanmar. It also remains unregulated despite authorities acknowledging its use in criminal and terrorist activity. However, with an expanding and modernising financial sector, there is now increasing competition and challenges facing Myanmar's hundi system. Design/methodology/approach This paper draws on available literature and open source reporting, as well as interviews with former Myanmar Police Force officials. Findings This study provides a unique insight into Myanmar's hundi system, its history and the challenges it faces. The once dominant system remains a known anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) risk and is having to compete with an expanding and modernising formal banking sector and the introduction of fintech and mobile money services. In the short term, these are unlikely to eliminate the hundi system completely, but may instead push hundi operators towards adopting these networks and technologies in their own operations. Originality/value Myanmar remains a very under-researched area and there has been a limited focus on its informal hundi remittance system and related AML/CFT issues. This paper will be a useful source for academics, development professionals, policymakers, law enforcement agencies and private sector actors seeking to understand Myanmar's informal remittance system.",Article,WOS:000479232700015

While considering the evolution of the concept of the business model of banks as financial intermediaries, the authors have revealed the principles of functioning of their adaptive business model in the conditions of proliferation of digitalization processes, wherein a customer-oriented sales approach, effective innovation development, and organizational flexibility became the main principles. To implement the adaptation business model, a system of transformation measures aiming at creating the main banking product, customer service technology, non-banking services has been substantiated. It has been proved that the evolutionary progress and the processes of digitalization led to the need of banks, based on the adaptive business model, to create an ecosystem as an effective integration market strategy that provides functional openness through any interface, the ability to create innovative products, interaction at the level of clients and institutions to increase cost, strengthening financial sustainability and increasing competitiveness. Modern tendencies concerning the transformation of the essence of an insurer as a subject of financial intermediation, principles and approaches of insurance of new types of assets and risks have been systematized; reactions to the spread of digital technologies and support of digital trends in the insurance market have been revealed; the need to change the insurers business model has been justified.",Article,WOS:000472077100018

Blockchain and cryptocurrencies will dramatically transform how we do transactions, just as the Internet revolutionized how we communicate. Currently, more than 2,000 cryptocurrencies are quoted on the market, and many more are being launched in initial coin offerings for use as an exchange method in a specific business ecosystem or as rights to assets or liabilities. As an emerging fintech, cryptocurrencies open up many opportunities, but they also pose significant challenges and limitations. This paper analyzes the key factors for the successful development of a cryptocurrency from a consumer-behavior perspective. Using a technology acceptance theoretical framework, we test a model able to explain almost 85% of the intention to use cryptocurrencies. Surprisingly, risk was not a significant factor. This could be because most of the respondents considered operating with cryptocurrencies to be risky; the lack of variability in their responses to the questions about perceived risk would explain this lack of explanatory power. However, willingness to manage cryptocurrency risk could be a precondition for adoption. The performance expectancy for a given cryptocurrency was the most important factor for its success.

Few scholars have studied the influence mechanism behind the adoption of Fintech services. This paper proposes an improved technology acceptance model (TAM) that incorporates user innovativeness, government support, brand image, and perceived risk as determinants of trust to investigate how users adopt Fintech services. We designed a questionnaire, sent it to active customers of the Hefei Science and Technology Rural Commercial Bank, and obtained 387 eligible responses. We analyzed the data with a structural equation model (SEM) to test the hypotheses, including the relationships of all latent variables. The results reveal that users' trust in Fintech services has a very significant influence on users' attitudes for adoption. In addition, perceived ease of use and perceived risk does not affect users' attitudes toward the adoption regarding Fintech services. This study contributes to the literature of the adoption of Fintech services by providing a more comprehensive view of the determinants of users' attitudes by combining trust of Fintech services with TAM.",Article,WOS:000464401800006

Indeed, the approach discussed here is applicable to general enterprises). The key idea of our new approach is to introduce and use the Hologram (similar to, holographic portrait used in portrait holography), a platform for data fusion dynamically, as a tool and mechanism to describe the dynamic evolution of SMEs based on their business dynamic behavior. Through processing structured and/or unstructured data in terms of related-party information sets which analyze (1) investment and (2) management information provided by SMEs' business behavior, and extracting Risk Genes from complex financial network structures in the business ecosystem, we can establish a good or bad rating for SMEs by using data fusion dynamically and financial technology. This method to assess SMEs is a new approach to evaluating SMEs' development dynamically based on the network structure information of enterprise and business behavior. The framework introduced in this paper for the dynamic mechanism of SMEs' development and evolution allows us to assess the risk of any SMEs (in particular to evaluate SMEs' loan applications) even not available for critical data required in traditional finance analysis including information such as financial accounting and associated assets, etc. This new Hologram approach for SMEs assessment is a pioneering innovation that incorporates big data and financial technology for inclusive financial services in practical application. Ultimately, the Hologram approach offers a new theoretical solution for the long-standing problem of credit risk assessment for SMEs and individuals in practice. Since the information embedded in SMEs' business behavior reveals the competition and cooperation mechanism that drives its stochastic resonance (SR) behavior which is associated with successful SMEs development, the two concepts of SAI and URR under the Hologram approach to risk assessment that identifies if an SME is good are based on the network generated from an SMEs' related-party information in terms of investment and management dynamically, along with other available information such as related investment capital and risk control. Significantly, the Hologram approach to risk assessment for SMEs does not require critical data of traditional financial account and related assets, etc. which heavily depend on financial accounting and associated assets used by financial risk analysis in practice. Using big data and FinTech Hologram method discussed in this paper utilizes the related-party information (in term of investment and management) of each SME which exists in an embedded business network to overcome the situation for SMEs which always have not or have not enough in providing accounting and associated asset information in the practice. By the feature of each Hologram for a given SME, one always has the related-party information in terms of either investment, or management dynamically, which is indeed also an explanation for the reason why the new approach proposed only comes true only until the era of big data's occurring by using ideas from financial technology today. Furthermore, this paper explores the implementation of the Holo Credit Loan, a pure credit loan without any collateral and guarantee launched in 2016, as practical applications of the Hologram approach. We illustrate the framework of SMEs risk assessment under the Holograms new theoretical basis for solving the long-standing problem of credit risk assessment for SMEs (and individuals). Moreover, this paper' conclusion will address the performance of the Holo Credit Loan.",Article,WOS:000463415900001

Complete information is considered one that offers financial and non-financial information. Government and supranational authorities are starting to promulgate rules to construct a reasonable framework for non-financial disclosure. One consumer might make a social conscious decision if the information disclosed meets to the Directive 2014/95/UE guidelines. In order to analyse this condition in the e-credit market in Spain, this research measures the rank of compliance of European standards in non-financial disclosure. The main finding of this research is that non-financial information disclosure in the Spanish e-credit market is not sufficient to make informed decisions. Due to the fact that most of the non-financial information is focused on social issues related to a company ' s commitment to sustainability, non-financial information plays a relevant role in the building of an economically sustainable society. Our findings show that the level of non-financial disclosure in the Spanish e-Credit market is low, what supposes there is not an adequate informative base to decision making according to European standards on non-financial information. By considering the effect of usual disclosure drivers in this research field, the e-credit market sector was the only positive factor to disclose more non-financial information. Nevertheless, company size, company seniority and company location were not significant factors for non-financial disclosure.",Article,WOS:000458929500311
"Irwin, ASM; Dawson, C",Following the cyber money trail Global challenges when investigating ransomware attacks and how regulation can help,2019.0,Financial crime; Attribution; Cryptocurrency; Ransomware; Bitcoin regulation,"Purpose The purpose of this paper is to show how global regulation of cryptocurrencies and other cybercurrencies can assist in addressing the challenges of attribution when investigating ransomware attacks and other types of cybercrime using these payment methods. Design/methodology/approach A literature review, looking at current academic research and discourse on the topic cryptocurrency regulation, is conducted to highlight current thinking and perceived difficulties in implanting a global regulatory framework. In addition, the research explores how governments have addressed the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and how regulation has been implemented. The research focuses on the regulatory approaches of Australia, Europe and the Americas to determine whether they could feasibly address the risks posed by cryptocurrencies and be implemented on a global scale. Findings To date, few sustained efforts have been made to regulate Bitcoin or other cybercurrencies. Where regulation has been introduced, it has often proven too costly to implement, thereby, stifling Bitcoin industry growth, or too ad hoc to function effectively. These regulatory pitfalls are substantiated by the continuing difficulty faced by law enforcement agencies, in identifying individual Bitcoin users and separating those that are using them for nefarious purposes from those that are using them for legitimate ones. These challenges appear to grow exponentially when it comes to prosecuting criminals for Bitcoin-related offences, due to the enormous lack of agreement within the justice system of most countries as to the appropriate legal definition for Bitcoin. This research highlights three characteristics that will be vital to the success of any global regulatory framework. These are consistency, clarity and cost-effective implementation. A regulatory framework for Bitcoin that lacks any one of these elements will fail to meet the requirements of every stakeholder in the regulatory process. A framework that is too costly to implement will stifle fintech innovation, subsequently depriving national economies of the multitude of potential benefits promised by fostering fintech entrepreneurship. Equally, a framework that is inconsistent will hamper the global cooperation necessary to combat Bitcoin-related crime. Originality/value This research evaluates research, discourse and regulatory responses from academic and governmental sources and discusses how a global response to cryptocurrency regulation will help address the growing problem of attribution when it comes to ransomware attacks, which has experienced a considerable spike in recent months.",Article,WOS:000463927000011

Modern payment market is considered in conjunction with the financial technology market. The objective of the research is to justify the development trends of the Russian payment services market. The study applied general methodological scientific principles (the unity of theory and practice, the objectivity, the complexity), as well as the systematic approach in assessing the holistic picture of the money circulation current state and the payment market in the context of digital innovation trends. The consumer payment services market in Russia analysis showed the tendencies towards the separation of cards' contact and contactless segments, as well as the restructuring of the market offer in favor of national issuers, the deregistration of the cash flow and substituting the traditional services with the innovative ones. Card payment instruments are a growing segment of the payment market both in Russia and in the Volgograd region. The key trend in card issuance is an increase in the number and volume of the MIR cards operations. The penetration rate and the frequency of contactless technologies usage are growing at the highest rates compared to the traditional forms and instruments of payments. The main trends in the distribution of mobile payment retail services are: the increase in the total cost of communication services, the availability of modern communication facilities and the quality of services provided by mobile operators (digitalization level); the competitive market formation; the number of active communication subscribers increase; the Internet services receipt intensification; the transfer of merchant and bank acquiring networks to contactless payments.

The results show that financial innovation within the research period is not only product-focused and in contrast mainly determined by IT-related innovations like risk management systems, credit scoring models and risk or pricing algorithms. The present empirical analysis furthermore addresses the simultaneous causality between innovation and risk-taking, which causes an endogeneity problem in the regression analysis. Two potential instrumental variables for innovation have been examined, which focus on the open-mindedness of the banks' headquarter environments in terms of racial and ethnic diversity and sexual orientation. The results underline the positive effects of an open-minded environment on the innovativeness of the financial industry. Innovation, synthesized by the instrumental variable Ssex, tends to decrease bank risk-taking.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000560369000069

However, the high-speed evolution of it has already caused a series of public security related events all around the world. Cryptocurrency was built initially as a possible implementation of digital currency, then various derivatives were created in a variety of fields such as financial transactions, capital management, and even nonmonetary applications. This paper aims to offer analytical insights to help understand cryptocurrency by treating it as a financial asset. We position cryptocurrency by comparing its dynamic characteristics with two traditional and massively adopted financial assets: foreign exchange and stock. Based on the daily close prices about four years, we first construct the correlation matrices and asset trees of all three markets, then conduct comparisons on five properties: volatility, centrality, clustering structure, robustness, and risk. Our investigation suggests that the dynamics of cryptocurrency are more similar to stock. As to the robustness and clustering structure, our analysis shows cryptocurrency market is more fragile than stock market, thus it is currently a high-risk financial market. Our work is the first to study cryptocurrency with the help of well-understood financial assets and may shed some light on investment decisions, regulation, and legislation.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000556106300025

Today banks are fighting for the client not only with other banks, but with all kinds of non-traditional financing companies such as the Fintech business models. These startups form the so-called Fintech sector, and are playing an exciting challenge to the established power of banking. Fintech are those financial technology startups that propose competing in a product or service with traditional banking. Fintech have been successful, being faster than banks when it comes to taking advantage of technological innovation to develop more user-focused banking products, at a lower cost or with a better customer experience, taking into account that potential customers they mostly belong to the Z and millennials generation, so digital channels are always optimized. Among the most important characteristics of this industry is that each of them has focused on a specific product or banking service. Its value proposal has been to radically improve the proposal of traditional banks in a given vertical, either in their costs, or in the user experience, or both at the same time. These new companies have been much faster than banks in taking advantage of the advances of digital technology to develop banking products that were more user-friendly, cost much less and were optimized for digital channels. For this reason, this research is aimed at the development of the Fintech industry in Ecuador, determining its risk and the potential actions of traditional banking against this disruption.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000554405500005

They are based on a combination of the capabilities of existing social networks and distributed ledger technology (DLT), as new subjects of competition in the banking sector of the market. The threat to commercial banks is determined by the risk of loss of income, in particular, commission income from transfer transactions that are already being executed in the social media environment, and which have the potential for growth in turnover. Despite the active development of crypto-innovations (algorithms, platforms, actually cryptocurrencies), the use of distributed ledger technologies by the banks themselves in the financial sector is still very modest. At the same time, social networks with a huge client base show an obvious interest in fintech prospects. These two components of the projects under discussion are contradictory and the success of integration is not obvious. Therefore, it is of interest to researchers in the financial sector.

These emerging countries, including India and China, have unsuccessfully tried to bridge the gap with developed nations, thereby remaining middle-income countries. The advent of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) revolution brought with it a new hope for these markets to compete directly with the developed nations. On top of this, AI delivers a greater impact of change and associated benefits to these markets compared with developed countries. To be competitive in the AI space one typically requires both, a mathematically literate talent pool and accessible data. If these are in place, investments usually follow. India and China, both, have a large pool of young, tech savvy mathematically literate talent. With the huge population and recent digitisation boom in both these countries, they are on a path to have the largest consumer data, unmatchable by any other economy. China and India now rank first and second respectively in terms of global internet data usage, leaving the US behind. With international investments flowing into Indian tech ventures, complemented with traditional home-grown businesses, India has risen to number two (52%) in the global Fintech adoption index, trailing only behind China (69%).

Each acceptance criterion is typically expressed as a natural-language statement with a clear pass or fail outcome. Writing AC is a tedious and error-prone activity, especially when the requirements specifications evolve and there are different analysts and testing teams involved. Analysts and testers must iterate multiple times to ensure that AC are understandable and feasible, and accurately address the most important requirements and workflows of the system being developed. In many cases, analysts express requirements through models, along with natural language, typically in some variant of the UML. AC must then be derived by developers and testers from such models. In this paper, we bridge the gap between requirements models and AC by providing a UML-based modeling methodology and an automated solution to generate AC. We target AC in the form of Behavioral Specifications in the context of Behavioral-Driven Development (BDD), a widely used agile practice in many application domains. More specially we target the well-known Gherkin language to express AC, which then can be used to generate executable test cases. We evaluate our modeling methodology and AC generation solution through an industrial case study in the financial domain. Our results suggest that (1) our methodology is feasible to apply in practice, and (2) the additional modeling effort required by our methodology is outweighed by the benefits the methodology brings in terms of automated and systematic AC generation and improved model precision.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000538727000024

In this context, banks may lose exclusivity and competitive advantage, but Fintechs rely on the banks' client portfolio; from this paradigm comes the need to adopt dynamic measures that could relate competitiveness and cooperation. This type of alliance promotes different types of innovation. Fintech's operations in the financial sector comply with certain European directives that can act as drivers or as obstacles, depending on the economic and social context of the country concerned. The purpose of this paper was to investigate the main motivations to engage in coopetitive strategic alliances between competitors, with the main focus on the relationship between Banks and Fintechs; and their impact on financial innovation. For this, a qualitative exploratory analysis was conducted, using semi-structured interviews. After the interviews, a case of a strategic alliance between a Bank and a Fintech was selected to be analyzed. After the triangulation between Literature Review, primary sources (interviews) and secondary sources (news and relevant documents), result analysis was conducted using the Systematic Combining approach. Regarding the main motivations to coopete with Banks, Fintechs need Bank's stability and credibility as well as their client portfolio. On the other hand, Banks need Fintech's strong technological capabilities and their ability to provide a better, faster and personalized service to customers. Also, it can be concluded, from the data, that the analyzed partnership provided important innovations for the financial sector. In respect to Regulation, the collected data allows the conclusion that this is an open matter, that can still be improved, so that both Banks and Fintechs answer to the same rules and obtain the same benefits. To summarize, this paper concludes that coopetition strategies between Banks and Fintechs can be an important positive driver in the development of the financial sector innovation.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000535852900044

This study adopts a deep learning technique called relation networks (RNs) to predict the exchange rates of fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies. To discover the relationship among different currencies, the concept of visual question answering (VQA) is applied in RNs. We also propose a specially designed architecture for the feature extraction stage to consider both spatial and temporal relationships simultaneously. The experimental results show that the proposed approach can achieve higher prediction performance for cryptocurrencies with approximately 65% accuracy rate.

Its emergence is triggered by the lifestyle changes of millennial people. Business activities nowadays increasingly developing and they lead to a healthy competition atmosphere. In order to compete well, the business activities require good capital and business considerations. The most important survival factors of businesses, especially those which develop in the millennial era are the capital, the good management and the good legal compliance. Fintech activities consist of 5 (five) categories of implementation, which are (a) a payment system; (b) a market support; (c) an investment management and a risk management; (d) lending, financing/funding, and capital raising; and (e) other financial services. A peer to peer lending which is part of fintech is the most appropriate choice in the millennial era and the acceleration of indemnity law provides facilities for easy debt servicing. How will the indemnity law in Indonesia develop with the existence of a peer to peer lending. This paper is based on the results of legal research conducted at Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (the Financial Services Authority) and several companies in Indonesia. A peer to peer lending is a breath of fresh air in Indonesia, especially for the indemnity law, and its presence certainly raises the pros and cons as well as its own problems.

Due to changing market conditions and stricter legal requirements for information duties to stakeholders, this paper focuses on the analysis of mandatory sustainable reporting with a specific focus on strategy. In particular, the perception of a changing market environment through digitisation in the banking sector will be analysed and interpreted. The framework of the Sustainability Code forms the basis of the analysis. Design/methodology/approach: Firstly, quantitative content analysis of n = 114 sustainability reports and, secondly, regression analysis of a total of 1410 codes related to digitisation were chosen as appropriate research methods. Keyword analysis deals with the analysis of sustainability reports of the German Sustainability Code and its four strategic criteria. These are searched and coded for the keyword 'digital'. Based on this, a regression analysis will be carried out following the respective coded sustainability reports. Findings: The findings revealed that, within the legally mandated sustainable reporting requirements, banks are partially, and not fully, concerned with reporting on digitisation. It turns out that the focus is on three out of four strategy criteria of the Sustainability Code. Strategical analysis methods are neglected, whereas Materiality, Objectives the Depth of the Value Chain issues receive increased attention. Research/practical implications: With regards to digitisation, the paper identifies a thematic imbalance within strategic sustainable reporting. It turns out that topics are not fully considered and addressed in a reporting approach prescribed by law, and that there is a high degree of freedom in the information duty to stakeholders. Originality/value: Since sustainable reporting has only recently become mandatory and it is a comparably new reporting approach, this paper focuses on precisely these and makes a contribution to the analysis and further development of the German Sustainability Code and the associated legal approaches.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000518586600011
"Ferguson, KK; Neubert, M",DIGITAL PAYMENTS - HOW NEW TECHNOLOGIES DISRUPT MONEY TRANSFER SYSTEMS IN AFRICA,2019.0,Digital Payments; FinTech; Africa; Innovation; Finance,"Purpose: The purpose of this qualitative exploratory multiple case study research is to explore subject-matter experts' (SMEs) perceptions of how technology and framework conditions influence and impact the success of digital payment business models in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this purpose, and to be consistent with the qualitative paradigm, a multiple case study methodology is used to collect data from multiple sources of evidence. Design/methodology/approach: This study uses an open-ended survey to collect data on SMEs perceptions. Data collection happened through semi-structured, qualitative, in-depth interviews with senior managers and entrepreneurs / owners in the financial technology sector. Data collection took place in Paris in November 2018. The interviews took between 32-46 minutes. The answers of the SMEs were imported, coded, and analyzed using NVivo for Mac. Findings: The findings suggest that growth of digital payment systems in sub-Saharan Africa might be driven by network effects and incentives, and a reduction Gourville's endowment effect or status quo bias. The results of this study suggest that infrastructure might key to the success of digital payment services and supportive regulation might be necessary to allow for entrepreneurs to drive innovation and to protect their customers against fraud. Research/practical implications: The FinTech environment is changing rapidly and requires review of the changes within the ecosystem of financial technology innovations. This study will help FinTech innovators, academics, and policymakers to understand how technology and framework conditions impact payment business models in sub-Saharan Africa. Originality/value: This paper builds on FinTech research and takes a more in-depth look at digital payment systems in sub-Saharan Africa using Gourville's (2006) theoretical framework on the psychology of new-product adoption. The added value of this study might be suggestions for quantitative research and recommendations for providers of digital payment systems in sub-Saharan Africa.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000518586600016

In particular it evaluates the impact of the national regulatory framework and the use of alternative credit risk assessment models applied by PPL-B on the credit access for SMEs. Design/Methodology: This research is based on a multiple case-study and the analysis of secondary information resources including 11 academics articles and 7 international research reports on the topic. The research scope is limited to a 5-year period (2013-2018) and looks at four referential countries in this sector including the United States, United Kingdom, China and Germany. Findings: PPL-B has become an important alternative source of financing for SMEs in the USA, UK and China. It furthermore suggests that the country-specific regulatory framework applied to PPL-B has an important impact on its growth and access to it for SMEs in these countries. Also, that the use of alternative data sources as applied by PPL-B platforms has a positive effect on the credit approval rates in the USA and China. Research/practical implications: The paper has direct implications for policymakers who can learn that SMEs can benefit from PPL-B if governments set up regulatory frameworks catered specifically for this sector. The paper informs investors and SMEs that the use of alternative data sources contributes to higher credit approval rates for SMEs. This research has several limitations due to the lack of data on the PPL-B sector and its impact on SMEs. To address these challenges, future research is to focus on in-depth country-specific studies that compare SMEs' credit access through traditional banking institutions and PPL-B platforms. Originality/value: This research responds to current lack of multiple-country studies that analyse the key factors to effective credit access for SMEs through PPL-B.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000518586600079

These changes determine the need of new approaches for the market behavior of both banks (to maintain competitive positions) and regulators (in order to prevent potential crisis phenomena). It is substantiated that at the present stage of development of financial-credit intermediation, determinants of competitive behavior of banks are nonconventional factors such as a degree of freedom to enter the market, an information asymmetry, a level of services and marketing support, an emergence of electronic channels for banking products' distribution, the development of electronic payment systems and transfers of other banking information. It is investigated main approaches to the definition of financial technologies (FinTech). It is justified the necessity of distinguishing this concept and the FinTech segment, it is proposed to define financial technologies in the narrow sense as the provision of financial services by non-banking institutions using modern information technologies, which is rationalizing the analysis of the FinTech's role in the banking. In the article it is identified and characterized external (caused by the objective development of society and fundamental changes in the banks' environment) and internal (caused by the need of maintaining the competitive positions by banks) factors of financial technologies' development. It is proved that the FinTech's impact on banking is determined by changes in the structure of the financial services market, a decrease in barriers to entry the market, and an increase of its spatial coverage. The development of FinTech leads to lower costs and higher efficiency of banks, increased competition in the banking environment, reduced information asymmetry, increased financial inclusion, but at the same time leads to the generation of new financial and technological risks for banks.",Article,WOS:000507543400007

Initially, few structures were developed to help cater to the attention of the Islamic financial industry players involved in peer-to-peer dealings. The new trend of the technological evolution in the banking and financial sector has proved to be the next challenge in this sector. However, the survival of Islamic fintech will heavily rely on the existing established trust within the sector. The potential collaborations between the established Islamic banks, fintech players and start-ups will certainly unleash the potentials of today's technologies in the Islamic finance industry. Being in their early stages, Malaysia and its counterparts from the GCC states have the potentials to becoming leaders in the Islamic fintech industry and may work together to develop a necessary framework for Islamic fintech advancement. Peer-to-peer arrangement connects crowdfunding investors with entrepreneurs through more transparency, speed dealings and almost free from complications in the documentation. In view of the fact that musharakah is becoming more practical under the concept of Islamic peer-to-peer deals, this paper attempts to develop a new peer-to-peer financing which is underlain by the Musharakah Smart Contract Model.

The development of digital banking is shown to bring both benefits (innovation and creation of new jobs) and problems. The latter can be solved in some ways, including through strengthening supervision of the digital banking development. In this regard, a comparative analysis of the above issues is of particular importance. Purpose: to develop an understanding of the fundamentals of legal regulation in digital banking in the European Union, USA, China, and Russia based on the analysis of regulatory acts, scientific sources, and judicial precedents. Methods: empirical methods of comparison, description, interpretation; theoretical methods of formal and dialectical logic; specific scientific methods: legal-dogmatic and the method of legal norms interpretation. Results: the study shows that the governments of the EU countries and the US see the solution to the problems associated with the legal regulation of digital banking in strengthening supervision of the digital banking development, which is expressed both in the adoption of new regulations and in the new powers of bodies exercising financial supervision (financial regulators); as for the Chinese government, until recently it was holding a position of non-interference. Conclusions: Russia lags behind the global giants of the Internet banking both in terms of the volume of digital monetary transactions and in the quality of legal regulation in the financial technology industry (FinTech), especially in the field of protecting the rights of consumers of digital financial services. In the European Union, depending on the type of activity, different regulator)) acts (regulations and directives) are applied that regulate payment services, crowdfunding, insurance, cybersecurity, etc. In the field of legal regulation of ayptocurrencies, the EU has not yet adopted any specific rules. In the United States, digital banking is governed primarily by regulations and case law relating to traditional banking. At the federal level, there is no regulation of new FinTech industries, for example, cryptocurrency. However, the situation is different at the level of states: on October 9, 2017, the U.S. Treasury Commission on Unification of Law (ULC) developed the Uniform Regulation of Virtual-Currency Business Act (URVCBA). In China, the government did not hasten to regulate the provision of digital financial services; therefore, Internet finance providers in this country received much more freedom to work than traditional financial institutions. This trend has led to a signcant expansion of population coverage (up to 40%). Moreover, despite the ban on private ayptocurrencies in China, the People's Bank of China has publicly encouraged public use of blockchain technology.",Article,WOS:000505064800001

I published an attempt to start a rigorous academic treatment of ideology in the blockchain space through my master's thesis titled Toward a Political Sociology of Blockchain at Queen's University. Since then, there have been continued rich discussions around politics and experimentation in line with the ideals of the blockchain movement. Examples include discussion of blockchain governance as a social contract, discussion of social scalability and how this enables us to organize, forums such as etherean.org, and movements such as RadicalxChange.org and the concept of Liberal Radicalism. Some of these movements have been started by similar actors in the blockchain space: Vitalik Buterin of the Ethereum project co-authored the paper on Liberal Radicalism which is deeply intertwined with RadicalxChange and the ethos of decentralization, and Lane Rettig is an Ethereum core developer and launched Etherean.org to be a non-maximalist community-based discussion of social aspects and implications around the emerging technology. While the cryptocurrency markets trended downward throughout 2018, there have been strong social indicators of a more mature system though increased interdisciplinary participation and development around the technology as well as increased interest by the public sector for use cases such as records keeping and identity solutions.

We compare the Payment Application Data Security Standard's (PA-DSS) applicability towards transaction-supported blockchain platforms to test the standard's applicability. By highlighting the differences in implementation on traditional and decentralized transaction platforms, we critique and adapt the standards to fit the decentralized model. In two case studies, we analyze the QTUM and Ethereum blockchain platforms' industry compliance, as their payment platforms support transactions equivalent to that of applications governed by the PA-DSS. We determine QTUM's and Ethereum's capabilities to properly ensure secure data handling with respect to current security standards. After adapting the PA-DSS and analyzing the QTUM and Ethereum platforms, we revise the new set of standards to create a set of best-practices for ensuring data security on both traditional and blockchain payment systems. We report the security gaps identified on each platform based on the final revision of the standards, presenting a conclusive perspective that neither platform is suitable for business adoption based on the PA-DSS standard's results.

The development of digital technology has an impact on the global banking market, its structure and services. Cloud technology, blockchain and Big Data, artificial intelligence, biometrics, and open source APIs are used by financial institutions both in routine client work (optical character recognition, language, voice, customer image and face recognition, etc.), and in complex analysis of unstructured data sets (pattern recognition in money laundering transactions, counter-terrorism financing). The major segments where the biggest changes were made - are retail, corporate banking, payments, bank transactions, investment banking, and infrastructure projects. There are considered the concept of open banking, its impact on the ecosystem of financial market. The use of digital technologies, on the one hand, increases competition and market efficiency, and on the other, creates new systemic risks to financial stability and integrity. The main obstacles to digital transformation are not technological ones, but the differences in the organizational culture of traditional banks and fintech, different strategic vision of top management, lack of qualified personnel, which makes it difficult for banks to transform for cooperation. The use of digital technology increases the systemic risks associated with cyber security, fraud and ethical issues. In order to reduce the fraud, it is important to improve the verification procedures: the integration of offline and online modes, the use of implicit factors, and consumer biometric behaviour. Given the likelihood of recession in the coming years, geopolitical problems, trade and currency wars, traditional banks need to transform their businesses in line with new trends.

Awareness of market chances, rising competitive constraints and the need to follow industrial customers to foreign markets, stimulates the interest of enterprises becoming international. But many of the small and medium sized enterprises lack the internal resources needed therefore and also the adaptation to new processes due to the digitalization. To have a successful internationalization process the framework conditions for the corporation, regarding to different aspects like available recourse and the degree of digitalization seems to be crucial. Small and medium sized enterprises from the FinTech branch looks on the surface fully adapted to the digital processes and with this, best conditioned for an international market entry. But have a look in detail, beside the origin digital products and services they offer, the internal processes often lack due to the requirements digitalization needs. The purpose of this research is to figure out the impact of digitalization on the success of business internationalization relating to German small and medium sized FinTechs. For the theoretical background, a literature research of the classical market entry strategies and a conceptual delimitation of small and medium sized German FinTechs should give an overview. For the empirical part, an online survey in 2018 among all German FinTechs was done. In a second step different experts on this field will be consulted to estimate the significance of the survey results and to validate the hypothesis.

In order to discover the factors that influenced the propensity to apply for FinTech loans, a theoretical model was designed, which was tested by means of a survey given to individuals who might contract loans. Design/methodology/approach - The final sample consisted of 507 individuals whose data were analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM), with estimation of partial least squares. Findings - From the results of the research, it was possible to draw a profile of the FinTechs of Brazilian loans and also to estimate the antecedents of the propensity to utilize this type of service. Research limitations/implications - The model proposed in this work was developed to measure the propensity to consume in relation to the credit services offered by lending FinTechs. Practical implications - The consumer should intensify the use of these channels to shape financial products and services to their needs, thereby democratizing access to credit, which is often restricted in quantity and quality by policies of institutions that dominate the Brazilian lending market. Originality/value - Aspects such as trust, personal innovation, perceived utility, ease of use and social influence, as well as the constructs that precede them like privacy, stigma and transactional distance, explain 41.5 percent of the propensity to use services from lending FinTechs in Brazil.",Article,WOS:000488528900006

Its pace and current trends require a completely scientific basis. Accordingly, the purpose of the study is to determine the impact of modern information technology in the banking systems of the European Union countries and the future prospects for their development. For this purpose, the hypothesis was, first of all, proposed that the level of business activity of the banking activity is related to the level of development of the country's economy and it will determine in the future the development of the banking systems of these countries. An appropriate empirical study was conducted to confirm this hypothesis. The systematization of literary sources and approaches to the solution of this problem has shown that in scientific sources the analysis of the impact of financial innovations on the banking systems of individual European Union countries is mainly carried out. Taking into account the different levels of development of these countries, these studies do not allow us to make conclusions and suggestions as to the future of European banks. Electronic banking, the creation of a large number of fi tech companies, crypto volume, blockade - radically change the classical banking business. These changes are gaining momentum and the future of the banking system is now very ambiguous. Will classical banks be able to function effectively, or will new financial companies come to their place? What should I do to manage the bank to lay the groundwork for its successful operation, in the context of the rapid development of information technology? Who and how will regulate global financial markets? There are no clear answers to these questions. The methodical toolkit of the study was a clustering method, methods of systematization, grouping, comparison, expert evaluations. The study period covers 2015-2018, which shows the most rapid dynamics of changes in the processes of customer service of banks from the offline to the online sphere. In addition, this period of time is characterized by the rapid development of financial innovation, which radically changes the approaches to traditional banking activities. The article presents the results of cluster analysis, the results of which allowed to group the countries of the European Union at different levels of digitalization. As a result, it was found that the most advanced economies and the most developed countries have the highest level of deductibility of banking activity (related to clusters 2 and 1). As a higher level of economic development provides more opportunities for investment, Internet access and better education of the population. In addition, it can be argued that it is the countries from the first group in the near future will or will become leaders in the European market of banking services, and it is on them that they will need to be guided by the orientation of the development of the banking system. The results of empirical analysis, have shown that banking institutions understand the lack of prospects of activities without financial innovation. On the other hand, as the study showed, such activity is characterized by high-risk banks. The issue of safety of up-to-date financial transactions is extremely important for supervisors who can not at the moment agree on what measures to apply and implement in order to minimize the risks of financial transactions. The study empirically confirms and theoretically proves that it is important to understand and justify the basic principles of the future development of banks, to identify and develop measures to minimize the levels of financial risks associated with the implementation of financial innovations, as well as to simply understand and evaluate changes expected by users of banking services during the next 5 to 10 years. The results of the research can be useful for scientists, management of banking and other financial institutions, as well as for users of banking services.",Article,WOS:000488243600013

These transformations are accompanied by radical changes in the financial behavior and thinking of economic agents, which are changing from the model of economic man to behavioral finance and modify the system of financial measurements - from the accounting tradition of analysis based on financial statements to the war of metrics (Metric wars). In this study, the author considers the problem of financial transformations in the economic systems of the industry level - by the example of the financial market. The driver of these transformations is FinTech (financial technology). Trends that have developed in this segment of the economy after the global crisis of 2007-2009, evidence the emergence of a new system quality in business models, not only inside the financial market, but also beyond it. This new systemic quality is a consequence of two objective megatrends: the financization of the economy, on the one hand, and its digitalization, on the other hand. Emergence of the new quality in the economic systems of the industry level makes it necessary to generalize the empirical experience and to interpret it from the point of view of fundamental theory.

It has been established that at present in the Russian banking system there are both competition and cooperation between traditional banks and Fintech companies in such areas as payments, lending to P2P, P2B, other areas of production and sale of banking services. The low level of financial literacy of the majority of the population is considered as a factor hindering the development of Fintech. The fact that there is already a Fintech ecosystem in Russia currently stands out. The authors identified a number of circumstances characterizing the current state of development of the Fintech in the banking system: an increase in the flow of venture financing of Fintech companies, relevant start-ups, the creation of research groups uniting the Government, private business, the creation of the Fintech Association, the Masterchain project, the rapid growth in Russia of users of Fintech. It is concluded that the active promotion of digital services by traditional banks and their symbiosis with Fintech companies create the conditions for the formation of a positive image of modern financial services. It is emphasized that the program of development of financial technologies of the Bank of Russia, in combination with the program of the Government of the Russian Federation Digital Economy of the Russian Federation, creates the legal and organizational basis for the successful development of financial technology in the future, including in the Russian banking system.

The purpose of the research: identification of the dominant trends in the transformation of the banking sector under the impact of financial technologies, development of theoretical and practical recommendations aimed at activating and stimulating the accelerated introduction of innovative banking products and services. As a result of the research, FinTech revealed trends in the financial market. FinTech segments are identified, in which banks lose to their competitors. It is determined that financial technologies pose a threat to banking organizations, in fact depriving them of monopoly power in the field of credit and ensuring monetary circulation. The main competitors, both for banks and for financial companies, are Big-tech companies. The possibility of merging FinTech companies with banks to improve the competitiveness of the banking sector is considered.

Almost in all countries offices of globally-operated banks wedged in national banking systems, grabbed a significant part of local clients pretending to a dominant position and, importantly, having enough resources to fulfil these plans. Digitalization process of the last several years has strengthened competition even more. It created new rivals for banks in the form offintech companies (FinTechs). FinTechs are substituting banks in many traditional markets, including payment services, assets management and financial consulting. They suggest clients to interact with them in a very cheap and convenient way. But at the same time FinTechs bring with them new risks for consumers because these non-bank institutions are not regulated with full-fledged tools which are used by central banks to secure stability in the banking system. Digitalization requires from banks to be on the edge of innovation and to give an adequate response to new challenges. Smart-offices of banks with a seamless technology of serving clients, broad qualification of staff and other special features is one of the means in the fight of real banks with quasi-banks or shadow banks with digital nature. Another challenge for all but especially for banks in a digital epoch is a cyber security.

We argue that alliances further enhance the organizational legitimacy of both fintech startups and incumbents.",Article,WOS:000460319200003
"Matsuura, K",Token Model and Interpretation Function for Blockchain-Based FinTech Applications,2019.0,FinTech; timestamp; blockchain; cryptocurrency; adapted stochastic process,"Financial Technology (FinTech) is considered a taxonomy that describes a wide range of ICT (information and communications technology) associated with financial transactions and related operations. Improvement of service quality is the main issue addressed in this taxonomy, and there are a large number of emerging technologies including block chain based cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. Due to its innovative nature in accounting, blockchain can also be used in lots of other FinTech contexts where token models play an important role for financial engineering. This paper revisits some of the key concepts accumulated behind this trend, and shows a generalized understanding of the technology using an adapted stochastic process. With a focus on financial instruments using blockchain, research directions toward stable applications are identified with the help of a newly proposed stabilizer: interpretation function of token valuation. The idea of adapted stochastic process is essential for the stabilizer, too.",Article,WOS:000457302000002
"Serrano, W",Fintech Bitcoin Smart Investment Based on the Random Neural Network with a Genetic Algorithm,2019.0,Genetic learning; Deep Learning Clusters; Reinforcement Learning; Random Neural Network; Smart Investment; Bitcoin; Fintech,"This paper presents the Random Neural Network in a Deep Learning Cluster structure with a new learning algorithm based on the genome model, where information is transmitted in the combination of genes rather than the genes themselves. The proposed genetic model transmits information to future generations in the network weights rather than the neurons. The innovative genetic algorithm is implanted in a complex deep learning structure that emulates the human brain: Reinforcement Learning takes fast and local decisions, Deep Learning Clusters provide identity and memory, Deep Learning Management Clusters take final strategic decisions and finally Genetic Learning transmits the learned information to future generations. This structure has been applied and validated in Fintech, a Bitcoin Smart Investment application based in an Intelligent Banker that performs Buy and Sell decisions on several Cryptocurrencies with an associated exchange and risk. Our results are promising; we have connected the human brain and genetics with Machine Learning based on the Random Neural Network model where Artificial Intelligence, similar as biology, is learning gradually and continuously while adapting to the environment.",Proceedings Paper,WOS:000456013900011

Considerations from a Civil Law perspective,2018.0,cryptocurrencies; money as a sign; dematerialization of the sign; FinTech perspectives,"The text starts from a review of new theoretical issues posed by cryptocurrencies with respect to traditional money. The research then shows how the essence of the traditional monetary phenomenon lies in the figure of money, understood as a symbol endowed with particular functions. Having said that, monetary functions can also be performed by cryptocurrencies. The text continues on to note that the cryptocurrencies phenomenon is but a continuation of the money dematerialisation process, which gained strong traction in particular during the last century. Today, FinTech is faced with a choice: whether to favour the application of technology to payments brokered by third parties, or to encourage the formation and circulation of these new monetary forms.",Article,WOS:000452436900004

While banks face sluggish innovation processes, fintechs take advantage of the digital era, delivering customer-centric solutions. Although banks have realized that cooperation with fintechs is a key approach to foster innovation, they struggle to address the associated challenges. Yet, there has been very little research into this phenomenon, so as to establish best practices, because neither bank-fintech cooperation, nor associated and relevant characteristics have been evaluated. However, especially from an economic and financial perspective it is crucial to close this research gap to better understand how technology-driven organizations and cooperating with them reshapes the financial sector and therefore entire economies. Thus, we propose a theoretically founded and empirically proven taxonomy. Based on the literature, 136 real-world cases, and 12 expert interviews, our results suggest structuring and describing bank-fintech cooperation through 13 dimensions. Further, the empirical examination allows for the identification of prevailing cooperation patterns. Our findings contribute to theory development on fintechs, their integration into the banking sector, and the cross-organizational cooperation research area. This paper also has practical implications for both banks and fintechs, and opens promising avenues for future research.",Article,WOS:000452350700003

This paper contends that any effective regulation of this new ecosystem requires adoption of the machinery of more fundamental concepts and a clear direction. Even if the Government's skepticism about soundness of the cryptocurrency markets is fully justified, how best to protect the various parties in the market is a different issue, one which calls for urgent attention from policy makers, legal practitioners, the judiciary and academic researchers. In particular, given the increasing number of startup Indonesian companies that have scrambled for seats in the new market, and the large number of related criminal cases reported in other jurisdictions, often involving hacking or embezzlement, the urgency to study best policy practices cannot be stressed enough. Against this backdrop, this paper analyzes the current legal status of virtual currency, related parties and activities in Indonesia absent direct laws and regulations to protect relevant parties..",Article,WOS:000457210900006

The participation of financial institutions in this ecosystem, although is rapidly improving, remains relatively low. This paper studies why some financial institutions choose to, or not to, participate in this nascent mobile payments ecosystem. We developed hypotheses for the influence of three factors as aspiration gaps, customer-facing IT capabilities, and institutional pressures based on three theoretical foundations including the threat rigidity thesis, capability-based view, and institutional theory. We then empirically tested our hypotheses by analyzing the diffusion of mobile payments among 3549U.S. credit unions from 2013 to 2016. Results from our event history analyses provide support to the hypotheses that credit unions experiencing performance gaps, having superior customer-facing IT capabilities, and facing strong institutional pressures are more likely to start providing mobile payment services.",Article,WOS:000443324000005
"Wang, J",From aperture satellite to Internet finance: Institutionalization of ICTs in China's financial sector since 1991,2018.0,Institutionalization; ICT diffusion; Fin-tech; Internet finance; China,"China's financial industries started the process of marketization only two decades ago, but by 2017 its financial technology or fin-tech sector had taken half of the global market. The exponential diffusion of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in Chinese financial contexts have generated new organizational structures and socio-political relations that have the capacity to change China's position in the world economy. Drawing upon the sociological concept of institutionalization, this paper examines how the Chinese state has integrated ICT diffusion in its formal policies and its informal rules in China's financial development since 1991. Further, it addresses the political and socio-economic consequences of these developments. Based on the analyses of government documents and sources, trade journals, and statistic data from business databases, this paper divides the Chinese institutionalization of financial technologies into three stages and identifies the primary actors and paradigms for ICT diffusions in each stage. ICT diffusion has been constitutive but also disruptive to the existing financial policies, instrumental to the commercialization of state-owned banks, and has gradually transformed into a set of formal and informal rules accepted by a network of professionals, corporations, and government agencies. The institutionalization of ICT diffusion has engendered the continuous adjustment of financial policies and propelled innovations in China's financial economy.",Article,WOS:000442066400005
